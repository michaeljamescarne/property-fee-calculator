# Cursor Network Access Issue

## Problem
Cursor's AI sandbox environment blocks network access for security reasons, preventing `git push` commands from working within Cursor.

## Solution: Use Terminal Outside Cursor

Since the sandbox restrictions can't be overridden from within Cursor, use your system terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/michaelcarne/Sites/aupropertyinvestment/property-fee-calculator
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Configure Git Credential Helper

If you want to avoid entering credentials repeatedly, configure Git credential helper:

```bash
# For macOS Keychain
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

# Or for HTTPS with token (recommended)
# Generate a Personal Access Token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Then use it when prompted for password
```

## Why This Happens

Cursor runs AI commands in a sandboxed environment that restricts:
- Network access (DNS resolution, HTTP/HTTPS)
- File system access (limited to workspace)
- System commands (limited for security)

This is by design to prevent AI from making unauthorized network requests.

## Workaround Script

You can create a simple script to push from terminal:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as: ~/push-to-production.sh
cd /Users/michaelcarne/Sites/aupropertyinvestment/property-fee-calculator
git push origin main
```

Then run: `~/push-to-production.sh`
