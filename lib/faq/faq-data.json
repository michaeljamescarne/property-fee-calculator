          "answer": "The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is an Australian government body that reviews foreign investment proposals. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, foreign persons must obtain FIRB approval before purchasing residential property in Australia. This ensures foreign investment benefits the Australian community and complies with national interest requirements.",

Simple residential property purchases by temporary residents usually process within 30 days, while more complex applications may take 90+ days.
