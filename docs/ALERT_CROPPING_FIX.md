# ✅ Alert Text Cropping Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Description
The alert message in the FIRB Calculator results page was being cropped at the bottom, showing only partial text like "Based on your citizenship status, you may not be eligible to purchase this type of prope..." (with "property" cut off).

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by multiple constraints in the Alert component:

1. **AlertTitle Constraint**: The shadcn AlertTitle component had `line-clamp-1` which limited the title to a single line
2. **AlertDescription Grid Layout**: The AlertDescription used CSS Grid with `col-start-2` which created layout constraints
3. **Container Width**: The main container had `max-w-5xl` which limited the available width
4. **Padding Issues**: Default Alert padding was too small for the content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Alert Component Layout
**File**: `components/firb/ResultsPanel.tsx`

```typescript
// Before (cropped):
<Alert className={`${getEligibilityColor()} border-2 w-full`}>
  <AlertTitle className={`text-xl font-bold ${getEligibilityTextColor()}`}>
    {eligibility.canPurchase ? t('eligible.title') : t('notEligible.title')}
  </AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription className={`mt-2 ${getEligibilityTextColor()} whitespace-normal break-words`}>

// After (fixed):
<Alert className={`${getEligibilityColor()} border-2 w-full !p-6`}>
  <div className="flex items-start gap-4 w-full">
    <div className={`${getEligibilityTextColor()} flex-shrink-0 mt-1`}>
      {getEligibilityIcon()}
    </div>
    <div className="flex-1 min-w-0 space-y-3">
      <AlertTitle className={`text-xl font-bold ${getEligibilityTextColor()} !line-clamp-none leading-tight`}>
        {eligibility.canPurchase ? t('eligible.title') : t('notEligible.title')}
      </AlertTitle>
      <AlertDescription className={`${getEligibilityTextColor()} !col-start-auto !grid-cols-none !text-base leading-relaxed`}>
```

### 2. Increased Container Width
**File**: `app/[locale]/firb-calculator/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Before:
<div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto">

// After:
<div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto">
```

### 3. Key CSS Classes Applied

- `!line-clamp-none`: Removes the single-line constraint on AlertTitle
- `!col-start-auto !grid-cols-none`: Overrides the grid layout constraints on AlertDescription
- `!p-6`: Increases padding for better spacing
- `space-y-3`: Adds proper vertical spacing between title and description
- `flex-shrink-0`: Prevents the icon from shrinking and affecting layout
- `leading-tight` and `leading-relaxed`: Improves text readability

## Verification

### ✅ Build Status
- Local build: Successful
- TypeScript: No errors
- Production deployment: Successful (commit e2fa4ac)

### ✅ Expected Results
- Alert text now displays in full without cropping
- Text wraps properly within the available space
- Better spacing and readability
- Responsive design maintained across devices

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to FIRB Calculator**: Go to `/en/firb-calculator`
2. **Complete the form**: Fill out citizenship, property details, and review
3. **Check Results**: Look at the eligibility alert at the top of results
4. **Verify**: Text should display completely without any cropping

### Test Cases
- ✅ Foreign citizen trying to buy established dwelling (shows restriction message)
- ✅ Australian citizen buying any property (shows eligible message)
- ✅ Temporary resident scenarios (shows FIRB required message)

## Files Modified

1. `components/firb/ResultsPanel.tsx` - Fixed Alert component layout
2. `app/[locale]/firb-calculator/page.tsx` - Increased container width

## Deployment Status

- **Commit**: e2fa4ac
- **Branch**: main
- **Production**: ✅ Live at https://aupropertyinvestmentmc.vercel.app/en/firb-calculator
- **Local**: ✅ Ready for testing
