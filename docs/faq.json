          "answer": "The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is an Australian government body that reviews foreign investment proposals. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, foreign persons must obtain FIRB approval before purchasing residential property in Australia. This ensures foreign investment benefits the Australian community and complies with national interest requirements.",

Simple residential property purchases by temporary residents usually process within 30 days, while more complex applications may take 90+ days.

          "question": "What happens if I need to leave Australia temporarily?",
          "answer": "Short-term absences (holidays, work trips) don't affect your FIRB obligations if the property remains your primary residence and you intend to return. For temporary residents, extended absences (>6 months) may trigger vacancy fee obligations if the property isn't genuinely rented out. Keep evidence of your intention to return and maintain the property as your residence (maintain utilities, personal belongings, etc.). Multiple properties or extended absences may require specific advice.",

          "question": "Can I transfer property to a family member?",
          "answer": "Transferring property to a family member is possible but has FIRB and tax implications. If the family member is a foreign person, they'll need FIRB approval. Transfers between spouses during marriage generally don't require approval but notify FIRB within 30 days. Transfers may trigger capital gains tax or stamp duty. Relationship breakdowns and inheritances have special provisions. Seek legal and tax advice before any transfer.",

          "question": "What if I declare bankruptcy?",
          "answer": "Bankruptcy doesn't automatically terminate FIRB obligations. If your property is sold by the bankruptcy trustee, standard FIRB disposal notifications apply. If the trustee sells to a foreign person, they'll need FIRB approval. Your bankruptcy won't exempt you from FIRB penalty obligations for past breaches. However, financial hardship may be considered in penalty assessments. Notify FIRB of bankruptcy and seek advice from your trustee.",
