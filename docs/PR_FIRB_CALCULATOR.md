## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Set up Environment Variable

Before testing, you need to set up Resend (for email functionality):

```bash
# Create .env.local file
echo "RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here" > .env.local
```

**To get a Resend API key:**
1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)
2. Verify your email
3. Create an API key
4. Copy key to `.env.local`

**Note**: Calculator works without email setup - only email feature will be disabled.

### 2. Pull and Test Locally

```bash
# Pull the feature branch
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/firb-calculator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Calculator

**English**: http://localhost:3000/en/firb-calculator  
**Chinese**: http://localhost:3000/zh/firb-calculator

#### Test Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Australian Citizen (No FIRB)**
- Citizenship: Australian Citizen
- Ordinarily Resident: Yes

**Scenario 2: Temporary Resident (FIRB Required)**

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables for Vercel

Add to Vercel project settings:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key
```

### Domain Configuration for Resend

After deployment, you'll need to:
1. Verify your sending domain in Resend dashboard
2. Update `lib/resend.ts` with your verified domain:
   ```ts
   from: 'FIRB Calculator <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
   ```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **No Database** - Stateless calculations (can add Supabase later for shareable URLs)
2. **No Authentication** - Open calculator (can add auth later for history)
3. **Email Requires Setup** - RESEND_API_KEY must be configured
4. **Simplified Calculations** - Some rates are approximations (noted in disclaimers)

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Not in This PR)

- Shareable calculation URLs (needs Supabase)
- User accounts & calculation history
- Save calculations for later
- More detailed suburb-level stamp duty
- Integration with real property APIs
- Admin analytics dashboard
