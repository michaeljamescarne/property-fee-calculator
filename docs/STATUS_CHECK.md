## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED

### ❌ Pull Request NOT Created Yet

Your changes are pushed to GitHub, but **you still need to create the pull request**.

**Current State**:
- Branch: `feature/slite-inspired-styling` ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- Main: Still on old code ❌ Not updated
- Production: Still on old code ❌ Not updated

**What's Missing**:
1. Pull Request needs to be created
2. Pull Request needs to be merged to `main`
3. Vercel will then auto-deploy to production

---

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Pull Request NOW

Go to: **https://github.com/michaeljamescarne/property-fee-calculator/pull/new/feature/slite-inspired-styling**

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://github.com/michaeljamescarne/property-fee-calculator
2. You should see a yellow banner saying "feature/slite-inspired-styling had recent pushes"
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"**
4. Review and click **"Create pull request"**

### Step 2: Review the PR

Check the "Files changed" tab to see all your updates:
- Should show ~14-16 files changed
- ~900+ lines added/modified
- All styling changes visible

### Step 3: Merge the PR

1. Click **"Merge pull request"**
2. Choose **"Squash and merge"** (recommended)
3. Confirm merge
4. Delete branch (optional)

### Step 4: Verify Auto-Deployment

After merge, Vercel will automatically:
- Detect merge to `main`
- Start deployment (~2-3 minutes)
- Update production

## 🔑 API Keys Status

### Vercel Environment Variables

You mentioned you've added both keys to Vercel. Let me verify they're configured correctly:

#### ✅ RESEND_API_KEY
**Status**: Should be added ✅
**Environment**: Production, Preview, Development
**Test**: Will work after deployment

#### ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
**Status**: Should be added ✅
**Environment**: Production, Preview, Development
**Test**: Will work after deployment

### ⚠️ Important Note

**The API keys won't work yet because**:
- Your code is on branch `feature/slite-inspired-styling`
- Production is still running code from `main` branch
- Need to merge PR first, then Vercel will redeploy with new code + API keys

---
