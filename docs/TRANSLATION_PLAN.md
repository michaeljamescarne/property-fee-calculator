## 💡 FAQ Translation Strategy

Given the size of the FAQ content, I recommend:

### **Strategy 1: Localized FAQ Data File** (Recommended)
Create `lib/faq/faq-data-zh.json` with Chinese translations:
- Separate file for maintainability
- Easier to manage and update
- Clear separation of concerns
- Load based on locale

### **Strategy 2: Inline Translations**
Keep single file with both languages:
- More compact
- Harder to maintain
- Larger file size
- More complex structure
