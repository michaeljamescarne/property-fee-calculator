## 📋 Quality Checks

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [x] All changes committed
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub
- [x] Build passes successfully
- [x] No linter errors (only intentional warnings)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] PR documentation created
- [ ] Local testing completed ← **YOU DO THIS**
- [ ] PR reviewed ← **YOU DO THIS**
- [ ] PR merged ← **YOU DO THIS**

### Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Production URL loads correctly
- [ ] All pages render properly
- [ ] Forms work correctly

- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Google Maps API key configured (if not already)

## 🔑 Environment Variables to Check

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

### Required for Full Functionality
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### How to Add in Vercel:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `aupropertyinvestmentmc`
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add each variable

**Note**: The app will work without these, but:
- Without Google Maps API: Address autocomplete won't work (falls back to text input)
- Without Resend API: Email functionality won't work (user can still download PDF)

## 📁 Branch Cleanup (After Merge)

Once merged and deployed successfully:

```bash
# Delete local branches (after merge)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/slite-inspired-styling
git branch -d feature/firb-calculator
git branch -d feature/add-footer

# Verify remote branches (optional)
git fetch --prune
```
