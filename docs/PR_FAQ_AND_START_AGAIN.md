## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach

**Deploy Now** (Low Risk):
1. ✅ FAQ System - Complete and tested
2. ✅ Start Again Button - Complete and tested

**Do NOT Deploy Yet** (Incomplete):
3. 🏗️ Investment Analytics - Keep in codebase but not user-accessible

**Why This Works**:
- FAQ and Start Again provide immediate value
- Investment foundation exists but hidden (no UI)
- Won't break anything
- Can continue building analytics separately

### Post-Merge Plan

1. **Merge this PR** - FAQ + Start Again go live
2. **Create new branch**: `feature/investment-analytics`
3. **Cherry-pick** investment files to new branch
4. **Complete** Phases 2-7 properly
5. **Deploy** when fully ready (separate PR)
