## How to Calculate Your Stamp Duty

### Method 1: Use Our Calculator
Our [FIRB Calculator](/firb-calculator) automatically calculates stamp duty for all states, including foreign buyer surcharges.

### Method 2: Manual Calculation
1. **Determine base rate** from state tables above
2. **Calculate base stamp duty** using progressive rates
3. **Add foreign buyer surcharge** if applicable
4. **Add any additional fees** (FIRB, legal, etc.)

### Example Calculation (NSW, $800,000 property):
- **Base stamp duty**: $31,087.50
- **Foreign buyer surcharge**: $64,000 (8% of $800,000)
- **Total stamp duty**: $95,087.50

## Tips for Minimizing Stamp Duty

### For Foreign Buyers:
1. **Consider lower-cost states** (NT, ACT have no surcharge)
2. **Look at new developments** (may qualify for grants)
3. **Factor in total costs** (not just stamp duty)
4. **Plan for ongoing costs** (land tax, etc.)

### For Australian Buyers:
1. **First home buyer concessions** (if eligible)
2. **New home grants** (check current availability)
3. **Off-the-plan purchases** (may have concessions)
4. **Regional areas** (may have additional incentives)

## Conclusion

Stamp duty costs vary significantly between states, with foreign buyer surcharges adding substantial additional costs. Use our comprehensive calculator to determine your exact costs and plan your property investment accordingly.
