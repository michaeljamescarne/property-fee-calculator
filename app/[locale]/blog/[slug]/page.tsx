# Complete FIRB Guide 2025: Everything You Need to Know About Foreign Investment in Australian Property

*Last updated: 15 January 2025 | 12 min read*

*This article has been updated with the latest FIRB regulations and policy changes.*

Thinking about investing in Australian property as a foreign buyer? Understanding FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board) requirements isn't just recommended—it's mandatory. This comprehensive guide breaks down everything you need to know about FIRB approval, fees, and compliance in 2025.

## What is FIRB and Why Does It Matter?

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) examines foreign investment proposals in Australia and advises the Treasurer on whether they align with Australia's national interest. For property investors, FIRB approval is the gateway to legally purchasing Australian real estate.

Think of FIRB as the gatekeeper ensuring that foreign investment benefits Australia while protecting domestic housing availability and national interests.

### FIRB's Key Responsibilities

- Reviewing and assessing foreign investment applications
- Advising the Treasurer on national interest concerns
- Monitoring compliance with approval conditions
- Protecting Australia's strategic and economic interests

## Do You Need FIRB Approval? Quick Check

### Foreign Persons Who Need Approval

You'll need FIRB approval if you're:

- A **foreign national** (non-Australian citizen)
- A **temporary resident** (including 457, 482, or student visa holders)
- A **foreign company** or trust
- Representing a **foreign government** or its agencies

### Who Doesn't Need FIRB Approval?

You're exempt from FIRB requirements if you're:

- An Australian citizen
- An Australian permanent resident
- A New Zealand citizen with a Special Category Visa (subclass 444)

## Understanding Property Types and Current Rules

### New Dwellings (Off-the-Plan and New Homes)

**Approval Status:** Required for foreign persons  
**Purpose:** Investment or primary residence  
**Restrictions:** None on the number of properties you can buy

New dwellings include properties that have never been occupied or sold as a place of residence. This category encompasses off-the-plan apartments, newly constructed houses, and substantially renovated properties that meet the "new dwelling" definition.

### Established Dwellings (Existing Homes)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: TEMPORARY BAN IN EFFECT**

From **April 1, 2025** to **March 31, 2027**, foreign persons (including temporary residents) **cannot** purchase established dwellings in Australia. This ban aims to ease housing pressure and increase availability for local buyers.

#### Limited Exceptions to the Ban

The ban doesn't apply if you're:

- **Redeveloping property** that will create at least 20 additional dwellings
- Investing in **commercial-scale housing developments** (build-to-rent with specific criteria)
- Purchasing under the **Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme**

#### What This Means for Temporary Residents

Previously, temporary residents could buy one established dwelling to live in while in Australia. This is no longer possible during the ban period. If you're on a temporary visa and want to buy property, you'll need to focus on new developments or vacant land.

**After the Ban Ends (Post-March 2027)**

Historical rules will likely resume:
- Established dwellings can only be purchased as your primary residence
- The property must be sold when it's no longer your main home
- You cannot rent the property to others while you own it

### Vacant Land

**Approval Status:** Required for foreign persons  
**Key Conditions:** 
- Construction must begin within **24 months** of purchase
- All construction must be completed within **4 years** of approval
- The land cannot be sold until construction is finished

These timelines are strictly enforced, with the government cracking down on "land banking" practices.

## FIRB Application Fees 2025/26

Application fees are indexed annually and vary significantly based on property type and value. Here's what you'll pay for applications from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026:

### New Dwellings & Vacant Land Fees

| Property Value | Application Fee |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Under $75,000 | $4,500 |
| Up to $1M | $15,100 |
| Up to $2M | $30,300 |
| Up to $3M | $60,600 |
| Up to $4M | $90,900 |
| Up to $5M | $121,200 |
| Up to $10M | $272,700 |
| Up to $20M | $575,700 |
| Up to $30M | $878,700 |
| Up to $40M | $1,181,700 |
| Over $40M | $1,205,200 |

*For the complete fee schedule including all price points, visit the [ATO website](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/foreign-resident-investments/foreign-investment-in-australia/fees-for-foreign-residential-investors).*

### Established Dwellings Fees (Tripled Rates)

⚠️ **Note:** While established dwellings are banned during April 2025–March 2027, these tripled fees apply to exceptional circumstances and will apply again after the ban ends:

| Property Value | Application Fee |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Under $75,000 | $13,500 |
| Up to $1M | $45,300 |
| Up to $2M | $90,900 |
| Up to $3M | $181,800 |
| Up to $5M | $363,600 |
| Up to $10M | $818,100 |
| Up to $20M | $1,727,100 |
| Up to $30M | $2,636,100 |
| Up to $40M | $3,545,100 |
| Over $40M | $3,615,600 |

The tripling of established dwelling fees reflects the government's policy to encourage foreign investment in new housing stock rather than existing homes.

### Additional Fee Information

**Expedited Processing:** You can pay double the standard fee for 10-day priority processing (subject to approval).

**Variation Fees:** If you need to modify an existing approval:
- Simple variation: $4,500
- Complex variation: $30,300

**Developer Certificates:** Property developers pay a flat $65,200 initial fee for New or near-new dwelling exemption certificates, plus per-sale fees for each dwelling sold to foreign persons.

## The FIRB Application Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility

Start by using the [FIRB Calculator on PropertyCosts.com.au](https://www.propertycosts.com.au/en/firb-calculator) to:
- Confirm whether you need approval
- Calculate your exact application fee
- Understand applicable conditions

### Step 2: Gather Required Documents

Before applying, prepare:

- **Passport copy** (certified if required)
- **Current visa documentation** (if applicable)
- **Property details** (address, purchase price, property type)
- **Financial statements** demonstrating capacity to purchase
- **Proof of funds** or financing pre-approval
- **Company documents** (if purchasing through a corporate entity)

### Step 3: Submit Your Application

Applications for residential property are submitted through the [ATO's online portal](https://www.ato.gov.au/). The process includes:

1. Creating an account or logging in
2. Completing the online application form
3. Uploading supporting documents
4. Paying the application fee
5. Receiving acknowledgment of submission

**Important:** The 30-day assessment period only begins once the correct fee is paid.

### Step 4: Assessment and Approval

The Treasury and FIRB typically assess applications within **30 days**, though this can be extended if additional information is needed or if the application raises national interest concerns.

You'll receive either:
- A **no objection notification** with conditions
- A request for more information
- In rare cases, a rejection

### Step 5: Compliance and Ongoing Obligations

Once approved, you must:

- **Purchase within the specified timeframe** (usually 12 months)
- **Comply with all conditions** attached to your approval
- **Report to FIRB** as required (e.g., when construction is completed)
- **Lodge annual vacancy fee returns** if applicable

## Understanding FIRB Conditions

Every FIRB approval comes with conditions you must follow. Here are the most common:

### For New Dwellings

- If purchasing as an investment, the property must eventually be sold to Australian citizens or permanent residents
- The property cannot be rented to foreign persons
- You must notify FIRB of any material changes to your circumstances

### For Vacant Land

- Construction must commence within **24 months**
- All dwellings must be completed within **4 years**
- Regular progress reports may be required
- The land cannot be sold until development is complete (with limited exceptions)
- Land banking is strictly prohibited

### For All Property Types

- The property must be used in accordance with the stated purpose in your application
- You must comply with all Australian laws and regulations
- You may be required to submit annual compliance reports

## The Cost of Non-Compliance: Penalties and Enforcement

The Australian government takes FIRB compliance seriously. In recent years, penalties have significantly increased, and enforcement has become more aggressive.

### Civil Penalties (Updated 2023–2025)

As of 2025, civil penalties for breaching FIRB regulations can include:

- **Individuals:** Up to $1.65 million (5,000 penalty units)
- **Corporations:** Up to $16.5 million (50,000 penalty units)

Common civil penalty offenses include:
- Failing to obtain FIRB approval before purchasing
- Breaching conditions of your approval
- Making false or misleading statements in your application
- Failing to advertise new dwellings to Australian buyers

### Criminal Penalties

Serious breaches can result in criminal prosecution:

- **Imprisonment:** Up to **10 years** for severe violations
- **Criminal fines:** In addition to or instead of imprisonment
- **Criminal record:** Affecting future visa applications and business opportunities

Criminal charges typically apply to:
- Willful violations of FIRB requirements
- Fraud or deliberate misrepresentation
- Repeated non-compliance after warnings
- Schemes designed to circumvent FIRB rules

### Unauthorized Acquisition Penalties

If you acquire property without proper FIRB approval, penalties are calculated as the **greater of**:

- **Double the capital gain** when you sell the property
- **50% of what you paid** for the property
- **50% of the property's current market value**

This means a $1 million property purchased without approval could result in a $500,000 penalty, plus you may be forced to sell.

### Vacancy Fee Penalties

Failing to comply with vacancy fee requirements can cost:

- Up to $165,000 for failing to lodge returns or pay fees
- From April 9, 2024, vacancy fees are **double the original application fee**
- Additional penalties for false declarations

### Forced Divestment

Beyond financial penalties, you may be ordered to **sell the property**:

- Often under unfavorable market conditions
- With no guarantee of recovering your investment
- Including all associated costs (legal fees, agent fees, stamp duty losses)

### Real Enforcement Examples

The government actively pursues non-compliance:

- **2015-2021:** 434 properties were forcibly disposed of
- **April 2022:** Federal Court imposed a $250,000 fine on a foreign investor for unauthorized purchases
- **Ongoing:** Enhanced audit programs targeting land banking and non-compliance
- **2024-2025:** Increased ATO enforcement with dedicated funding for residential property compliance

## Annual Vacancy Fees: What You Need to Know

If you purchased a residential property after May 9, 2017 with FIRB approval, you may need to pay an annual vacancy fee.

### When the Vacancy Fee Applies

You'll pay this fee if your property is:

- Not occupied for at least **183 days** (6 months) during the "vacancy year"
- Not available for rent for at least 183 days during the vacancy year
- Available for rent but at an unrealistic price that prevents renting

### How Much You'll Pay

The vacancy fee equals **double your original FIRB application fee** (for properties purchased after April 9, 2024).

**Example:** If you paid $30,300 for FIRB approval to purchase a $2 million new apartment, your annual vacancy fee would be $60,600 if the property remains vacant for more than 6 months.

### How to Comply

Each year you must:

1. Lodge a **vacancy fee return** by the due date (usually within 30 days after your "vacancy year" ends)
2. Pay any fees owing
3. Keep records proving occupancy or rental availability

## Tips for Successful FIRB Applications

### Before Applying

- **Start early:** FIRB approval takes at least 30 days, often longer
- **Get professional advice:** Consider engaging a lawyer or specialist consultant
- **Check the ban:** Ensure your intended purchase isn't affected by the established dwelling ban
- **Calculate all costs:** Use the PropertyCosts calculator to understand total expenses
- **Arrange finance:** Get pre-approval before applying to FIRB

### During the Application

- **Be thorough:** Incomplete applications cause delays
- **Be honest:** False information can lead to criminal charges
- **Respond quickly:** If FIRB requests more information, provide it promptly
- **Keep records:** Save all correspondence and documents
- **Check your timeline:** Don't sign purchase contracts before receiving FIRB approval

### After Approval

- **Read your conditions carefully:** Understand exactly what you must do
- **Set reminders:** For construction deadlines, vacancy returns, and reporting requirements
- **Maintain records:** Keep proof of compliance (rental agreements, construction invoices, etc.)
- **Seek clarification:** Contact FIRB or the ATO if you're unsure about anything
- **Report changes:** Notify FIRB if your circumstances change materially

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I buy property with my Australian citizen spouse?**  
A: Yes, but the structure matters. If you're purchasing as joint tenants or tenants in common, you'll typically need FIRB approval for your share. If your spouse is purchasing alone and you're not on the title, FIRB approval isn't required. Be cautious: arrangements designed to circumvent FIRB can be illegal.

**Q: What happens if the ban extends beyond March 2027?**  
A: The government will review the ban before it expires and announce any extension. If it's extended, existing approvals remain valid, but new applications for established dwellings will continue to be rejected (except for exempted categories).

**Q: Can I buy multiple new properties?**  
A: Yes. Foreign persons can purchase unlimited new dwellings and vacant land, subject to obtaining FIRB approval and paying the fee for each property.

**Q: How long does FIRB approval last?**  
A: Typically 12 months from approval date. If you don't complete the purchase within this period, you may need to reapply and pay a new fee.

**Q: Can I rent out my property while I'm overseas?**  
A: For new dwellings purchased as investments, yes—this is expected. For established dwellings purchased as your primary residence (after the ban ends), no—you must sell when you leave Australia permanently or it's no longer your main residence.

**Q: What if I purchased property without FIRB approval?**  
A: Contact a lawyer immediately. You may be able to apply for retrospective approval, but expect significant penalties regardless. During the current ban period, retrospective approval for established dwellings is generally not being granted.

## Looking Ahead: FIRB Policy Changes

Australia's foreign investment policy evolves in response to housing market conditions and national interest considerations. Recent changes include:

- **2023-2024:** Tripling of established dwelling fees and doubling of vacancy fees
- **April 2025:** Implementation of the two-year established dwelling ban
- **2025:** Enhanced compliance measures and increased audit activity
- **2025-2026:** Streamlined processing for "low-risk" investments in new housing

The government has signaled that FIRB policy will continue adapting to support housing affordability for Australians while still welcoming beneficial foreign investment.

## How to Calculate Your Stamp Duty

### Method 1: Use Our Calculator
Our [FIRB Calculator](/firb-calculator) automatically calculates stamp duty for all states, including foreign buyer surcharges.

### Method 2: Manual Calculation
1. **Determine base rate** from state tables above
2. **Calculate base stamp duty** using progressive rates
3. **Add foreign buyer surcharge** if applicable
4. **Add any additional fees** (FIRB, legal, etc.)

### Example Calculation (NSW, $800,000 property):
- **Base stamp duty**: $31,087.50
- **Foreign buyer surcharge**: $64,000 (8% of $800,000)
- **Total stamp duty**: $95,087.50

## Tips for Minimizing Stamp Duty

### For Foreign Buyers:
1. **Consider lower-cost states** (NT, ACT have no surcharge)
2. **Look at new developments** (may qualify for grants)
3. **Factor in total costs** (not just stamp duty)
4. **Plan for ongoing costs** (land tax, etc.)

### For Australian Buyers:
1. **First home buyer concessions** (if eligible)
2. **New home grants** (check current availability)
3. **Off-the-plan purchases** (may have concessions)
4. **Regional areas** (may have additional incentives)

## Conclusion

Stamp duty costs vary significantly between states, with foreign buyer surcharges adding substantial additional costs. Use our comprehensive calculator to determine your exact costs and plan your property investment accordingly.

# Chinese Investor's Guide to Australian Property Investment

Australia has long been a favoured destination for Chinese property investors, drawn by its stable economy, high-quality education, clean environment, and strong capital growth prospects. This guide provides essential insights for Chinese nationals looking to invest in Australian real estate.

## Why Australia?

- **Economic Stability**: A resilient economy with consistent growth
- **Education**: World-class universities and schools, a major draw for families
- **Lifestyle**: High quality of life, diverse culture, and beautiful natural landscapes
- **Strong Market**: Historically strong property market with good long-term growth
- **Proximity**: Relatively close proximity to Asia compared to other Western investment destinations

## Key Considerations for Chinese Investors

### 1. FIRB Regulations

All foreign persons, including Chinese nationals, must obtain approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) before purchasing residential property in Australia.

- **New Dwellings**: Generally permitted without significant restrictions
- **Established Dwellings**: ⚠️ **TEMPORARY BAN** (April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027) - Currently NOT permitted for foreign persons
- **Vacant Land**: Permitted for development, with conditions to complete construction within a specified timeframe

Our [FIRB Calculator](/firb-calculator) can help you understand your eligibility and estimated FIRB fees.

### 2. Capital Controls in China

Chinese investors face capital outflow restrictions imposed by the Chinese government. Individuals generally have an annual foreign exchange quota. Strategies to manage this include:

- **Multiple Family Members**: Utilizing quotas from various family members
- **Offshore Funds**: Using funds already held outside mainland China
- **Commercial Channels**: Exploring legitimate commercial channels for larger investments

It's crucial to seek independent financial advice regarding transferring funds from China.

### 3. Banking and Finance

Obtaining finance in Australia as a foreign investor can be challenging. Australian banks have tightened lending criteria for non-residents.

- **Deposit Requirements**: Expect higher deposit requirements (often 30-40% or more)
- **Income Verification**: Strict verification of overseas income
- **Foreign Currency Risk**: Be mindful of exchange rate fluctuations if income is in CNY and mortgage repayments are in AUD

Many Chinese investors opt for cash purchases or use international lenders with a presence in Australia.

### 4. Taxation

Beyond stamp duty and FIRB fees, be aware of ongoing taxes:

- **Land Tax**: Annual state-based tax on land value
- **Capital Gains Tax (CGT)**: Applies to profits made from selling property. Foreign residents are generally not eligible for the CGT main residence exemption
- **Foreign Purchaser Surcharge (Stamp Duty)**: An additional duty on top of standard stamp duty in most states

### 5. Cultural and Practical Aspects

- **Feng Shui**: Many Chinese buyers consider Feng Shui principles when selecting a property
- **Location**: Proximity to good schools, Asian supermarkets, and established Chinese communities (e.g., Sydney's Chatswood, Melbourne's Box Hill) is often highly valued
- **Professional Advice**: Engage trusted, bilingual professionals (real estate agents, lawyers, accountants, migration agents) who understand both Australian regulations and Chinese cultural nuances

## Start Your Australian Property Journey

Australia offers a secure and prosperous environment for property investment. With careful planning and professional guidance, Chinese investors can successfully navigate the market.

# Visa Types & FIRB Requirements: Complete Breakdown for Australian Property

Understanding how your Australian visa status impacts Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) requirements is critical before purchasing property. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of FIRB rules based on common visa categories.

## Who is a "Foreign Person" for FIRB Purposes?

Generally, a "foreign person" includes:

- An individual not ordinarily resident in Australia
- A corporation or trust in which a foreign person or persons hold a substantial interest

Your visa status directly influences whether you are considered "ordinarily resident" or a "temporary resident," which in turn dictates the FIRB rules that apply to you.

## FIRB Requirements by Visa Type

### 1. Australian Citizens & Permanent Residents

- **FIRB Approval**: **Not required.** Australian citizens and permanent residents are generally exempt from FIRB approval for residential property purchases
- **Spouses**: If an Australian citizen or permanent resident is purchasing property as joint tenants with their foreign spouse, FIRB approval is generally not required

### 2. New Zealand Citizens

- **FIRB Approval**: **Not required.** New Zealand citizens are generally exempt from FIRB approval for residential property purchases
- **Spouses**: Similar to Australian citizens, if a New Zealand citizen is purchasing property as joint tenants with their foreign spouse, FIRB approval is generally not required

### 3. Temporary Residents (e.g., 482, 457, Student Visas, 309/100, 820/801)

Temporary residents are individuals who hold a valid temporary visa that allows them to reside in Australia for a continuous period of more than 12 months, and who have resided in Australia for 12 months or more.

- **Established Dwellings**: Generally, temporary residents **need FIRB approval** to purchase one established dwelling to use as their principal place of residence
  - **Condition**: The property must be sold when they cease to reside in it or when their temporary visa expires, whichever comes first
  - **Important Update**: **As of April 1, 2025, there is a temporary ban on foreign persons (including temporary residents) purchasing established dwellings in Australia, effective until March 31, 2027.** During this period, FIRB applications for established dwellings by temporary residents will generally not be approved
- **New Dwellings**: Temporary residents **need FIRB approval** to purchase new dwellings. There are generally no restrictions on the number of new dwellings, but each purchase requires approval
- **Vacant Land**: Temporary residents **need FIRB approval** to purchase vacant land for residential development, with conditions to complete construction within a specified timeframe (usually 4 years)

### 4. Foreign Nationals (No Visa / Tourist Visa)

Individuals who are not Australian citizens, permanent residents, New Zealand citizens, or temporary residents are considered "non-resident foreign persons."

- **Established Dwellings**: Generally **not permitted** to purchase established dwellings. **This is reinforced by the temporary ban from April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027**
- **New Dwellings**: **Need FIRB approval** to purchase new dwellings. There are generally no restrictions on the number of new dwellings, but each purchase requires approval
- **Vacant Land**: **Need FIRB approval** to purchase vacant land for residential development, with conditions to complete construction within a specified timeframe (usually 4 years)

## Key Takeaways

- **Always check FIRB**: If you are not an Australian or New Zealand citizen, assume you need FIRB approval
- **Temporary Ban**: Be acutely aware of the temporary ban on established dwellings for foreign persons (including temporary residents) from April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2027
- **Conditions Apply**: FIRB approvals often come with strict conditions that must be adhered to

# New vs Established Property: What Foreign Buyers Need to Know in Australia

For foreign investors looking to enter the Australian property market, one of the most fundamental decisions is whether to purchase a new dwelling or an established property. The rules, costs, and investment implications differ significantly. This guide breaks down the key considerations.

## Defining "New" and "Established" Dwellings

- **New Dwelling**: A dwelling that has not been previously sold as a dwelling, or has been substantially renovated and sold, or has been built on vacant land. This includes off-the-plan purchases
- **Established Dwelling**: Any dwelling that is not a new dwelling. This includes existing houses, apartments, and townhouses that have been previously occupied or sold

## FIRB Rules: A Critical Difference

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) applies vastly different rules to new versus established properties for foreign persons.

### Purchasing New Dwellings

- **General Rule**: Foreign persons (including non-residents and temporary residents) are generally permitted to purchase new dwellings
- **Approval**: FIRB approval is still required for each new dwelling purchase
- **Benefits**: Encourages the supply of new housing, often fewer restrictions
- **No Limit**: Generally, there is no limit to the number of new dwellings a foreign person can purchase, provided each purchase receives FIRB approval

### Purchasing Established Dwellings

- **General Rule for Non-Residents**: Non-resident foreign persons are generally **prohibited** from purchasing established dwellings
- **Temporary Residents**: Temporary residents generally **need FIRB approval** to purchase one established dwelling to use as their principal place of residence. They must sell it when they cease to reside in it or when their visa expires
- **Important Update: Temporary Ban (April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027)**: There is a temporary ban on foreign persons (including temporary residents and foreign-owned companies) purchasing established dwellings in Australia. During this period, FIRB applications for established dwellings by temporary residents will generally not be approved
- **Exemptions**: Very limited exemptions exist, such as for foreign-owned companies purchasing established dwellings for their Australian-based employees (subject to conditions)

## Costs and Taxes

### Stamp Duty & Surcharges

- **New Dwellings**: Standard stamp duty applies, plus foreign purchaser surcharges in most states
- **Established Dwellings**: Standard stamp duty applies, plus foreign purchaser surcharges in most states (where permitted)

### FIRB Fees

- FIRB application fees apply to both new and established dwelling purchases (where permitted), tiered by property value

## Investment Potential

### New Dwellings

- **Pros**: Modern amenities, potential for depreciation benefits (tax), often located in master-planned communities, contributes to housing supply
- **Cons**: May be in developing areas with less established infrastructure, potential for oversupply in some markets, off-the-plan risks (e.g., builder delays, changes to plans)

### Established Dwellings

- **Pros**: Often in prime, established locations with existing infrastructure and amenities, potential for immediate rental income, land value appreciation
- **Cons**: Higher maintenance costs, older infrastructure, **significant FIRB restrictions for foreign buyers (especially with the temporary ban)**

## Conclusion

The choice between new and established property is heavily influenced by your foreign investment status and the prevailing FIRB regulations. While new dwellings offer more straightforward pathways for most foreign buyers, established properties in desirable locations can be attractive if you meet the strict eligibility criteria.

# FIRB Fees Breakdown 2025: Complete Foreign Investment Cost Guide

For foreign investors eyeing the Australian property market, understanding the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) application fees is a non-negotiable part of the budgeting process. These fees are a mandatory cost for most foreign acquisitions of Australian residential real estate. This guide provides a comprehensive breakdown of FIRB fees in 2025.

## What are FIRB Application Fees?

FIRB application fees are charges imposed by the Australian Government for processing applications from foreign persons seeking to invest in Australia. These fees contribute to the administration of Australia's foreign investment framework.

## Key Principles of FIRB Fees

- **Mandatory**: If FIRB approval is required, the fee must be paid upon application
- **Tiered Structure**: Fees are tiered based on the value of the proposed investment. Higher value investments incur higher fees
- **Non-Refundable**: Fees are generally non-refundable, even if the application is withdrawn or rejected
- **Annual Indexation**: Fees are typically indexed annually on 1 July, so it's crucial to check the most current schedule. The figures below are based on the latest available guidance (e.g., FIRB Guidance Note 10, Version 6, March 14, 2025)

## FIRB Residential Land Application Fees (2025)

**Source**: Australian Taxation Office - Foreign Investment Fees (1 July 2025 – 30 June 2026)

The following table outlines the typical fees for purchasing residential land (new dwellings, established dwellings where permitted, and vacant land).

| Property Value Range | Application Fee |
| :------------------- | :-------------- |
| Up to $1 million     | $15,100         |
| $1 million - $2 million | $30,300         |
| $2 million - $3 million | $45,500         |
| $3 million - $4 million | $60,600         |
| $4 million - $5 million | $75,800         |
| $5 million - $6 million | $91,000         |
| $6 million - $7 million | $106,200        |
| $7 million - $8 million | $121,400        |
| $8 million - $9 million | $136,600        |
| $9 million - $10 million | $151,800        |
| For every additional $1 million or part thereof above $10 million, the fee increases by $15,100 |

*Note: These fees are for a single dwelling. Different fee structures apply for commercial property, multiple dwellings in one application, or developed residential land.*

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

**Source**: Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, Treasury announcements (penalties doubled effective January 1, 2023)

It is critical to comply with FIRB regulations. Significant penalties apply for breaches, including:

- **Civil Penalties**: For individuals, fines can be up to **$6,660,000** (30,000 penalty units × $222 per unit). For corporations, fines can be up to **$66,600,000** (300,000 penalty units × $222 per unit)
- **Criminal Penalties**: Imprisonment for up to **10 years**
- **Forced Divestment**: The foreign person may be forced to sell the property, often at a loss

## Other Costs to Budget For

FIRB fees are just one component of the total investment cost. Foreign buyers must also consider:

- **Stamp Duty**: State-based tax on property transfers, often with additional foreign purchaser surcharges
- **Legal/Conveyancing Fees**: For professional legal services
- **Lender Fees**: If obtaining a mortgage
- **Building & Pest Inspections**: Recommended for established properties
- **Council Rates & Land Tax**: Ongoing annual costs

# Australian Property ROI Calculator: Complete Investment Analysis Guide

Understanding the potential Return on Investment (ROI) is paramount for any property investor, especially for foreign buyers navigating the Australian market. Our FIRB Calculator goes beyond just fees, offering a robust ROI analysis to help you make informed decisions. This guide explains how to calculate ROI and what factors influence it in Australia.

## What is ROI in Property Investment?

Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment. In property, it helps you understand the financial gain or loss relative to the initial cost.

**Basic ROI Formula:**
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100%

However, property ROI is more complex, involving both rental yield and capital growth.

## Key Components of Australian Property ROI

### 1. Rental Yield

This measures the annual rental income as a percentage of the property's value.

**Gross Rental Yield Formula:**
(Annual Rental Income / Property Value) x 100%

**Net Rental Yield Formula:**
((Annual Rental Income - Annual Expenses) / Property Value) x 100%

- **Factors Affecting Yield**: Location, property type (house vs. apartment), local rental demand, property condition
- **Australian Context**: Rental yields vary significantly across cities and regions. Generally, regional areas might offer higher yields than capital cities, but capital growth can differ

### 2. Capital Growth

This is the increase in the property's value over time.

- **Factors Affecting Capital Growth**: Economic conditions, interest rates, population growth, infrastructure development, local supply and demand, zoning changes
- **Australian Context**: Australian property markets, particularly in major capital cities, have historically shown strong long-term capital appreciation

### 3. Total Investment Costs

Accurately calculating your "Cost of Investment" is crucial. For foreign buyers, this includes:

- **Purchase Price**
- **FIRB Application Fees** (verified 2025 rates)
- **Stamp Duty** (including foreign purchaser surcharges)
- **Legal/Conveyancing Fees**
- **Lender Fees & Mortgage Insurance** (if applicable)
- **Buyer's Agent Fees** (if used)
- **Initial Renovation/Maintenance Costs**

### 4. Ongoing Expenses

These reduce your net profit and include:

- **Loan Interest Payments**
- **Council Rates**
- **Land Tax** (including foreign owner surcharges - NSW increased to 5% as of January 1, 2025)
- **Strata/Body Corporate Fees** (for apartments/townhouses)
- **Property Management Fees**
- **Insurance**
- **Maintenance & Repairs**
- **Vacancy Costs**

- **Minimize Vacancy**: Keep good tenants and maintain the property well
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consult a tax advisor to understand deductions and depreciation benefits
