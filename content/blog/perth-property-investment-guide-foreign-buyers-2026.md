# Perth Property Investment Guide for Foreign Buyers (2026)

_Last updated: 6 January 2026 • 14 min read_

Perth has been Australia's standout property market. While Sydney and Melbourne have oscillated between modest gains and corrections, Perth has surged—median dwelling values climbing over 75% since March 2020, with annual growth rates consistently leading the nation.

For foreign investors, Perth presents a rare combination: strong capital growth, exceptional rental yields (4.5-6.5%), and crucially, **lower foreign buyer costs than any eastern state capital**. Western Australia charges a 7% foreign buyer stamp duty surcharge versus 8-9% in NSW/VIC, and imposes **no foreign owner land tax surcharge at all**—a significant ongoing cost advantage.

But Perth is not without complexity. Its economy remains tied to resources, its market has historically been volatile, and the extreme supply shortage that has driven recent growth won't last forever. This guide shows you how to capitalise on Perth's strengths while managing its unique risks.

## Perth's Investment Landscape: Understanding the Opportunity

Perth is Australia's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.2 million, capital of Western Australia, and gateway to the nation's resources sector. Its property market operates on different fundamentals than the eastern capitals—understanding these dynamics is essential for foreign investors.

### Why Perth Is Attracting Foreign Investment

**Exceptional Recent Performance**

Perth has delivered Australia's strongest property returns (data as of late 2025):

- **Annual growth:** 8-11% for houses, 11-15% for units
- **Median dwelling value:** ~$914,000
- **Median house price:** $810,000-$926,000
- **Median unit price:** $565,000-$650,000
- **Five-year growth:** Over 75% since March 2020

This performance has pushed Perth's median house price past Melbourne's for the first time, making it Australia's fourth most expensive capital after Sydney, Canberra, and Adelaide.

**Severe Supply Shortage**

The fundamental driver of Perth's growth is a profound supply-demand imbalance:

- **Stock levels:** 45% below the five-year average
- **New listings:** Down 28% year-on-year
- **Days on market:** Just 11-13 days (properties sell within two weeks)
- **Construction pipeline:** Insufficient to meet population growth

This shortage shows no immediate signs of easing. Building approvals remain subdued, construction costs have risen sharply, and labour shortages persist. For investors, this means sustained upward pressure on values—at least in the medium term.

**Exceptional Rental Yields**

Perth offers Australia's best rental returns among major capitals:

- **Median weekly rent (houses):** $690-$755
- **Median weekly rent (units):** $650
- **Gross rental yield:** 4.5-6.5% (versus 2.5-3.5% in Sydney)
- **Vacancy rate:** 0.7% (critically low)

A vacancy rate below 1% indicates extreme rental market tightness. Landlords have significant pricing power, and properties lease within days of listing. For yield-focused foreign investors, this is compelling.

**Population Growth Engine**

Western Australia's population growth of 2.8% (2023) is among the highest in Australia, driven by:

- **Interstate migration:** Australians relocating from expensive eastern cities
- **International migration:** Skilled workers for resources and healthcare sectors
- **Natural increase:** Young demographic profile

This population influx creates sustained housing demand that outpaces new supply.

**Resources Sector Strength**

WA's economy is underpinned by iron ore, lithium, gold, and natural gas exports. Major projects including:

- Ongoing iron ore expansion (Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue)
- Lithium development for EV batteries
- LNG projects in the Pilbara
- Rare earths and critical minerals

These industries generate high-paying jobs that flow through to housing demand in Perth.

### The Challenges You Need to Understand

**Resources Dependency Risk**

Perth's fortunes are linked to commodity prices, particularly iron ore. A significant decline in global demand—whether from China's property slowdown or broader economic factors—could impact:

- Employment in mining and related services
- Population growth (migration patterns can reverse quickly)
- Property demand and values

Perth experienced this during the 2014-2019 downturn when house prices fell approximately 20% following the end of the mining construction boom. While current fundamentals differ, this historical volatility warrants consideration.

**Affordability Ceiling Approaching**

Perth's rapid price growth is creating affordability constraints:

- Median house prices have risen $200,000+ in two years
- Price-to-income ratios are widening
- First-home buyers increasingly priced out of desirable suburbs
- Rental stress affecting tenant capacity to pay higher rents

When affordability becomes stretched, growth typically moderates. The question is when, not if.

**Geographic Isolation**

Perth is one of the world's most isolated major cities:

- 4+ hour flight from Sydney/Melbourne
- 6-8 hour flight from major Asian hubs
- Limited direct international connections compared to eastern capitals

For foreign investors, this means:

- Property inspections require significant travel commitment
- Fewer service providers specialising in foreign buyers
- Potentially smaller pool of future foreign buyers when selling

**Eastern Investor Retreat**

Perth's affordability advantage over eastern cities has narrowed significantly. When Perth's median was $500,000 versus Melbourne's $900,000, eastern investors poured in. Now that Perth has matched Melbourne, that flow has slowed:

- Fewer interstate buyers at open homes
- Reduced buyer's agent activity from eastern states
- More price-sensitive local market

This isn't necessarily negative—it suggests the speculative froth is reducing—but it may moderate future growth rates.

## The Complete Cost Breakdown for Foreign Buyers

Perth offers material cost advantages for foreign investors compared to eastern capitals. Let's examine the complete picture.

### FIRB Application Fees (2025-26 Financial Year)

| $7-8 million      |                           $212,100 |
| $8-9 million      |                           $242,400 |
| $9-10 million     |                           $272,700 |
| Over $10 million  | Additional $30,300 per $1M bracket |

### Western Australia Stamp Duty

WA's stamp duty structure combines base rates with a 7% foreign buyer surcharge—lower than NSW (9%), VIC (8%), QLD (8%), and TAS (8%).

**Base transfer duty rates:**

| Property Value    | Rate                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| $0-$120,000       | 1.9%                                    |
| $120,001-$150,000 | $2,280 + 2.85% of excess over $120,000  |
| $150,001-$360,000 | $3,135 + 3.8% of excess over $150,000   |
| $360,001-$725,000 | $11,115 + 4.75% of excess over $360,000 |
| Over $725,000     | $28,445 + 5.15% of excess over $725,000 |

**Foreign purchaser surcharge:** 7% of the total property value (flat rate)

### Real Cost Examples

**Example 1: $750,000 Perth apartment (new dwelling)**

| Cost Item                    |      Amount |
| :--------------------------- | ----------: |
| Purchase price               |    $750,000 |
| Standard stamp duty          |    ~$29,600 |
| Foreign buyer surcharge (7%) |     $52,500 |
| **Total stamp duty**         | **$82,100** |
| FIRB application fee         |     $15,100 |
| Legal/conveyancing           |      $2,000 |
| **Total upfront costs**      | **$99,200** |

**Percentage of purchase price: 13.2%**

**Comparison with NSW ($750,000 property):**

- NSW stamp duty + surcharge (9%): ~$97,500
- NSW FIRB fee: $15,100
- NSW total: ~$114,600
- **Perth saves: $15,400 upfront**

**Example 2: $1.2 million Perth house (new dwelling)**

| Cost Item                    |       Amount |
| :--------------------------- | -----------: |
| Purchase price               |   $1,200,000 |
| Standard stamp duty          |     ~$52,900 |
| Foreign buyer surcharge (7%) |      $84,000 |
| **Total stamp duty**         | **$136,900** |
| FIRB application fee         |      $30,300 |
| Legal/conveyancing           |       $2,500 |
| Building inspection          |         $700 |
| **Total upfront costs**      | **$170,400** |

**Percentage of purchase price: 14.2%**

### The Land Tax Advantage: Perth's Hidden Benefit

This is where Perth truly differentiates itself for foreign investors.

**Western Australia imposes NO foreign owner land tax surcharge.**

Compare this to eastern states:

| State  | Foreign Owner Land Tax Surcharge |
| :----- | :------------------------------- |
| NSW    | 4% of land value annually        |
| VIC    | 4% of land value annually        |
| QLD    | 2% of land value annually        |
| SA     | None                             |
| **WA** | **None**                         |
| TAS    | 2% of land value annually        |

**What this means in practice:**

For a $1 million property with $400,000 land value:

- **NSW annual surcharge:** $16,000/year
- **VIC annual surcharge:** $16,000/year
- **QLD annual surcharge:** $8,000/year
- **WA annual surcharge:** $0

**Over 10 years:**

- NSW/VIC: $160,000+ in foreign surcharge land tax
- WA: $0

This is a material ongoing cost advantage that compounds significantly over a long holding period. Combined with lower upfront stamp duty surcharge, Perth can save foreign investors $100,000-$200,000+ over a 10-year hold compared to NSW or Victoria.

### Standard WA Land Tax (Still Applies)

While there's no foreign surcharge, standard WA land tax applies to investment properties:

- **Threshold:** $300,000 (aggregated land value)
- **Rates:** Progressive from $300 up to 2.67% for values over $11 million
- **Assessment date:** 30 June each year

For a $1 million property with $400,000 land value:

- Standard WA land tax: approximately $1,200-$1,500/year

This is dramatically lower than eastern states even before foreign surcharges are considered.

## FIRB Regulations: What You Can Buy in Perth

FIRB rules apply nationally—Perth has no special exemptions or additional restrictions. Understanding FIRB requirements is essential for foreign property investors.

### Current Rules

**What foreign buyers CAN purchase:**

✅ **New dwellings**

- Off-the-plan apartments
- House-and-land packages
- Newly constructed properties never previously occupied
- No limit on number of properties
- FIRB approval required for each purchase

✅ **Vacant land**

- For residential development
- Must commence construction within 24 months
- Must complete within 4 years
- Cannot sell until construction complete

**What foreign buyers CANNOT purchase:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Established Dwelling Ban Currently In Effect**

Foreign persons (including temporary residents) are **currently banned** from purchasing established dwellings in Australia. This prohibition took effect on 1 April 2025 and remains in force until 31 March 2027.

**What this means right now:**

- You cannot purchase any existing house, apartment, or townhouse that has been previously occupied
- The ban applies regardless of whether you want to live in the property or invest
- Temporary residents who previously could buy one established dwelling as a principal residence no longer have this option

**Very limited exceptions apply only to:**

- Redevelopment projects creating 20+ additional dwellings
- Commercial-scale build-to-rent developments meeting specific criteria
- PALM scheme worker accommodation

**For foreign investors in Perth today:** The significant stock of established houses in Perth's desirable established suburbs—Subiaco, Mount Lawley, Fremantle, Claremont—is off-limits. Your investment options are strictly limited to new builds, off-the-plan purchases, and vacant land with development intent.

For comprehensive information on FIRB regulations and what foreign buyers can purchase, see our [ultimate FIRB guide 2025](/en/blog/ultimate-firb-guide-2025).

### Perth-Specific FIRB Considerations

**Developer exemption certificates:** Many Perth developers hold exemption certificates for their projects. If buying from such a developer:

- No individual FIRB approval required
- Must notify ATO within 30 days of purchase
- Streamlines the purchase process significantly

**Vacancy fee obligations:** If your property is vacant or not genuinely available for rent for 183+ days per year, you must pay an annual vacancy fee equal to **double** your original FIRB application fee.

For a $750,000 property:

- FIRB fee: $15,100
- Annual vacancy fee (if applicable): $30,200

This makes leaving properties empty extremely costly. Ensure you have a rental strategy from day one.

## Where to Invest: Perth's Opportunity Zones

Perth's property market varies dramatically by location. Strategic suburb selection is essential.

### Perth CBD and Inner City

**Areas:** Perth CBD, East Perth, West Perth, Northbridge, Subiaco

**The opportunity:**

- Proximity to major employment
- Walkable lifestyle precincts
- Strong tenant demand from professionals
- New apartment developments (FIRB-eligible)

**The risk:**

- Apartment oversupply in some buildings
- CBD vacancy rates higher than suburban
- Smaller apartments struggle to attract families

**Investment profile:**

- Median apartment: $550,000-$750,000
- Gross yield: 4.5-5.5%
- Capital growth: Moderate (lagging houses)
- Target tenant: Young professionals, FIFO workers

**Strategy:** Focus on quality buildings with limited stock (under 100 apartments), near train stations, with good owner-occupier appeal. Avoid large investor-dominated towers.

### Western Suburbs (Premium)

**Areas:** Cottesloe, Claremont, Nedlands, Dalkeith, Peppermint Grove

**The opportunity:**

- Perth's prestige locations
- Beach and river proximity
- Excellent schools (private school belt)
- Strong long-term capital growth

**The risk:**

- Very high entry prices ($2M-$10M+)
- Lower rental yields (2.5-3%)
- Limited new development opportunities

**Investment profile:**

- Median house: $2M-$5M+
- Gross yield: 2-3%
- Capital growth: Strong long-term
- Target tenant: Executives, expat families

**Strategy:** Ultra-high-net-worth investors only. Focus on land value and generational wealth preservation. New dwelling opportunities are rare—typically custom builds.

### Northern Corridor

**Areas:** Joondalup, Wanneroo, Clarkson, Butler, Alkimos, Yanchep

**The opportunity:**

- Significant new development (FIRB-eligible stock)
- House-and-land packages from $500,000-$700,000
- Growing infrastructure (train extensions, shopping centres)
- Strong rental demand from families

**The risk:**

- Distance from CBD (45-60+ minutes)
- Dependent on infrastructure delivery
- Some areas may face oversupply

**Investment profile:**

- Median house: $550,000-$750,000
- Median apartment: $400,000-$500,000
- Gross yield: 5-6%
- Capital growth: Moderate-strong (infrastructure dependent)

**Specific suburbs to consider:**

- **Joondalup:** Established centre, university, hospital, train station
- **Alkimos:** Newer area, significant growth pipeline
- **Yanchep:** Emerging, train extension planned

**Strategy:** Focus on areas with confirmed transport infrastructure. House-and-land packages offer good value for yield-focused investors.

### Southern Corridor

**Areas:** Rockingham, Mandurah, Baldivis, Wellard

**The opportunity:**

- Affordable entry points
- Strong rental yields (5-6%+)
- Lifestyle appeal (beaches, waterways)
- Young family demographic

**The risk:**

- Distance from Perth CBD
- Employment concentration concerns
- Mandurah historically volatile

**Investment profile:**

- Median house: $500,000-$650,000
- Gross yield: 5.5-6.5%
- Capital growth: Variable

**Strategy:** Rockingham and Baldivis offer better fundamentals than Mandurah. Focus on proximity to train stations and employment centres.

### Eastern Suburbs

**Areas:** Belmont, Rivervale, Victoria Park, Bayswater, Midland

**The opportunity:**

- Close to CBD and airport
- Undergoing gentrification
- More affordable than western suburbs
- Strong tenant demand

**The risk:**

- Variable suburb quality
- Some areas have social housing concentration
- Airport noise in eastern suburbs

**Investment profile:**

- Median house: $700,000-$900,000
- Median apartment: $450,000-$550,000
- Gross yield: 4.5-5.5%
- Capital growth: Strong (gentrification play)

**Specific suburbs to consider:**

- **Victoria Park:** Café strip, young professionals, excellent transport
- **Bayswater:** Train station, improving amenity
- **Rivervale:** Close to CBD, undervalued

**Strategy:** Focus on pockets with improving amenity. Look for new townhouse developments that appeal to owner-occupiers and tenants.

### Fremantle and Surrounds

**Areas:** Fremantle, East Fremantle, North Fremantle, South Fremantle

**The opportunity:**

- Historic port city character
- Strong lifestyle appeal
- University of Notre Dame presence
- Tourism and hospitality employment

**The risk:**

- Heritage restrictions on development
- Limited new dwelling supply
- Parking and traffic challenges

**Investment profile:**

- Median house: $1M-$1.5M
- Median apartment: $600,000-$800,000
- Gross yield: 3.5-4.5%
- Capital growth: Moderate-strong

**Strategy:** Premium lifestyle investment. Limited new dwelling opportunities—typically boutique developments. Strong owner-occupier appeal supports values.

### Suburbs to Approach with Caution

❌ **Burswood units:** Despite prime riverside location, unit prices collapsed 20%+ in 2024. Oversupply and large investor-only buildings.

❌ **Large apartment towers in CBD:** High strata fees, investor saturation, limited owner-occupier appeal.

❌ **Very outer suburbs without transport:** Areas 60+ minutes from CBD without train access face liquidity challenges.

❌ **Mining town proxies:** Suburbs dominated by FIFO workers can be volatile when resources sector slows.

- Rent growth: 4% annually
- Expense growth: 3% annually

| Year | Property Value | Annual Rent | Annual Costs | Cash Flow |
| :--- | -------------: | ----------: | -----------: | --------: |
| 1    |       $850,000 |     $31,850 |     -$54,485 |  -$22,635 |
| 3    |       $955,000 |     $34,500 |     -$57,800 |  -$23,300 |
| 5    |     $1,073,000 |     $37,300 |     -$61,300 |  -$24,000 |
| 7    |     $1,206,000 |     $40,400 |     -$65,000 |  -$24,600 |
| 10   |     $1,522,000 |     $45,600 |     -$71,200 |  -$25,600 |

**10-year summary:**

| Item                                   |       Amount |
| :------------------------------------- | -----------: |
| Property value (Year 10)               |   $1,522,000 |
| Capital gain                           |     $672,000 |
| Less CGT (32.5% for foreign residents) |    -$218,400 |
| Net capital gain                       |     $453,600 |
| Loan principal repaid (~10 years)      |     ~$85,000 |
| **Total equity built**                 | **$538,600** |

**Total capital invested:**

- Initial outlay: $366,700
- 10 years negative cash flow: ~$240,000
- **Total invested:** $606,700

**10-year ROI:** $538,600 ÷ $606,700 = **88.8% total** or **6.5% annually**

### Comparison: Same Investment in Melbourne

If you invested the same $606,700 in a Melbourne property:

**Additional costs in Victoria:**

- Higher stamp duty surcharge (8% vs 7%): +$8,500
- Foreign land tax surcharge (4% annually): ~$160,000 over 10 years

**Melbourne total additional cost: ~$168,500**

This effectively wipes out nearly one-third of your Perth returns. The WA cost advantage is substantial and compounds over time.

## Managing Your Perth Investment Remotely

Foreign investors face unique management challenges with Perth's geographic isolation.

### Property Management Selection

Perth has fewer property managers specialising in foreign buyers compared to Sydney or Melbourne. Critical selection criteria:

✅ **Experience with foreign owners:** Understanding of FIRB compliance, vacancy fee returns, tax withholding requirements

✅ **Tenant quality focus:** Perth's tight market doesn't mean every tenant is good. Thorough screening essential.

✅ **Responsive communication:** Time zone differences matter less within Australia, but responsiveness is still crucial

✅ **Transparent reporting:** Online portals with real-time access to statements, inspection reports, maintenance logs

✅ **Competitive fees:** Perth property management typically 7-8% of rent plus leasing fees

### Dealing with FIFO Tenants

Perth's rental market includes many Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) workers. Key considerations:

**Advantages:**

- Often higher income, reliable rent payment
- Property may be empty 2 weeks per month (less wear)
- Long-term leases common

**Disadvantages:**

- May leave suddenly if mining job ends
- Property sits empty during roster periods
- Single-income vulnerability

**Strategy:** FIFO tenants can be excellent, but verify employment stability and consider requiring guarantors.

### Tax Compliance

Same obligations apply as other states:

- **Rental income:** Taxable in Australia, requires TFN
- **Annual tax returns:** Must file even if living overseas
- **Withholding:** Property manager withholds tax if no valid TFN provided
- **Capital gains tax:** 32.5% on profit (no 50% discount for foreign residents)
- **Vacancy fee returns:** Annual lodgement required even if property was occupied

Engage an Australian accountant experienced with foreign property investors.

## Perth vs. Other Australian Cities

### Perth vs. Sydney

**Perth advantages:**

- 40% lower median prices
- Double the rental yield (5% vs 2.5%)
- 2% lower stamp duty surcharge (7% vs 9%)
- No foreign land tax surcharge (saves $15,000+/year)
- Faster sales (11 days vs 30+ days)

**Sydney advantages:**

- Historically stronger capital growth (7-8% vs 5-6% long-term)
- More diverse economy
- Larger, more liquid market
- Better international connectivity

**Verdict:** Perth offers substantially better yield and lower costs. Sydney offers potentially better long-term capital growth and lower volatility.

### Perth vs. Melbourne

**Perth advantages:**

- Similar median prices but stronger recent growth
- Significantly higher rental yields
- 1% lower stamp duty surcharge (7% vs 8%)
- No foreign land tax surcharge (vs 4% in VIC)
- Lower vacancy rates

**Melbourne advantages:**

- More diverse economy
- Stronger education sector
- Better public transport
- Larger market with more property options

**Verdict:** Perth offers clear cost advantages and stronger current fundamentals. Melbourne offers more economic diversity and potentially lower long-term volatility.

### Perth vs. Brisbane

**Perth advantages:**

- Higher rental yields
- Stronger recent capital growth
- No foreign land tax surcharge (vs 2% in QLD)
- Same stamp duty surcharge (both 7%)

**Brisbane advantages:**

- 2032 Olympics infrastructure investment
- More affordable entry points
- Subtropical climate
- Growing tech and services sector

**Verdict:** Both are strong markets for foreign investors. Perth leads on yield; Brisbane may offer better lifestyle appeal and Olympic-driven growth catalysts.

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

Some Perth properties should be avoided regardless of price:

❌ **Large CBD apartment towers (200+ units):** Oversupply, investor saturation, high vacancy rates

❌ **Properties marketed exclusively to overseas buyers:** Often overpriced, targeting less informed purchasers

❌ **Buildings with very high strata fees ($100+/sqm annually):** Erodes returns significantly

❌ **Properties in mining-dependent suburbs without diversification:** Vulnerable to resources downturn

❌ **Off-the-plan with unknown developers:** Research track record thoroughly—Perth has seen developer failures

❌ **Properties with sunset clauses under 18 months:** Insufficient time for construction and market protection

❌ **Suburbs with declining population or amenity:** Check ABS data and local development plans

## Final Thoughts: Is Perth Right for You?

Perth offers foreign investors a compelling proposition: strong recent performance, exceptional rental yields, and materially lower costs than eastern capitals. The absence of foreign owner land tax surcharge alone can save $100,000+ over a 10-year hold.

**Perth is right for you if:**

- You prioritise rental yield and cash flow
- You can accept resources sector exposure
- You have a 7-10+ year investment horizon
- You want to minimise ongoing foreign buyer costs
- You're comfortable with geographic isolation from eastern capitals
- You can sustain modest negative cash flow in early years

**Perth may not be right for you if:**

- You need maximum liquidity and market depth
- You're concerned about single-sector economic exposure
- You want proximity to Asian business connections
- You're investing for less than 5 years
- You require extensive on-the-ground support services

Perth's property market has delivered exceptional returns, but past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The supply shortage driving current growth will eventually ease, and the resources sector remains cyclical.

Success in Perth requires careful suburb selection, realistic cost modelling, and the patience to hold through market cycles. For foreign investors willing to do the work, Perth offers genuine opportunity—with lower barriers than any eastern state capital.
