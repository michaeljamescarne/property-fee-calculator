# Australian Property ROI Calculator: Complete Investment Analysis Guide

Comprehensive guide to calculating property investment returns, rental yields, and capital growth for Australian real estate investments.

## Understanding Property ROI

**Return on Investment (ROI)** is a key metric for evaluating the profitability of property investments. It measures the return generated on the capital invested in a property.

### Types of Property Returns
- **Rental yield**: Annual rental income as percentage of property value
- **Capital growth**: Increase in property value over time
- **Total return**: Combined rental yield and capital growth
- **Cash flow**: Net income after all expenses

## Rental Yield Calculations

### Gross Rental Yield
**Formula**: (Annual Rental Income ÷ Property Value) × 100

#### Example: $800,000 Property
- **Property value**: $800,000 AUD
- **Annual rent**: $35,000 AUD
- **Gross yield**: ($35,000 ÷ $800,000) × 100 = 4.38%

### Net Rental Yield
**Formula**: ((Annual Rental Income - Annual Expenses) ÷ Property Value) × 100

#### Example: $800,000 Property
- **Property value**: $800,000 AUD
- **Annual rent**: $35,000 AUD
- **Annual expenses**: $15,000 AUD
- **Net yield**: (($35,000 - $15,000) ÷ $800,000) × 100 = 2.5%

### Rental Yield by City (2024)
