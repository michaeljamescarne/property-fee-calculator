# New vs Established Property: Complete Guide for Foreign Buyers in Australia 2025

*Last updated: 5 January 2025 | 12 min read*

Choosing between new and established property is one of the most critical decisions for foreign investors in Australia—and it's not just about personal preference. Your foreign investment status fundamentally determines what you can buy, with FIRB rules creating vastly different pathways for each property type.

This comprehensive guide compares new versus established properties across every dimension that matters: FIRB eligibility, costs, investment returns, tax implications, and long-term strategy. By the end, you'll know exactly which option suits your situation.

## Understanding the Critical Definitions

Before diving into comparisons, you need to understand exactly how FIRB classifies properties—because these definitions determine what you can legally purchase.

### What is a "New Dwelling"?

A property qualifies as a "new dwelling" if it meets ANY of these criteria:

**1. Never Previously Sold as a Dwelling**
- Brand new construction that has never been sold
- House built on vacant land and never occupied
- Apartment in a new development, never settled

**2. Never Previously Occupied**
- Has been built but never lived in
- Applies even if technically "completed" months ago
- Must truly be unoccupied—not even short-term rentals

**3. Substantially Renovated and Unoccupied**
- Property has undergone substantial renovation
- Has not been occupied since the renovation
- **AND** has not been occupied for more than 12 months total since construction

**Common examples of new dwellings:**

✅ **Off-the-Plan Apartment**
- Purchased before completion
- Never previously occupied
- Bought directly from developer

✅ **House-and-Land Package**
- Vacant land purchased with building contract
- House constructed to your specifications
- First occupants will be you or your tenants

✅ **Recently Completed Display Home**
- Used only as display (not residential occupation)
- Being sold by developer
- Never actually lived in as a home

✅ **Newly Constructed Townhouse**
- Part of new development
- Just completed, never occupied
- Selling through developer or immediately after

✅ **Substantially Renovated Property**
- Completely gutted and rebuilt
- Has been empty since renovation (under 12 months)
- Effectively a "new" home in an old structure

**Example of what counts as new:**
A developer demolishes an old house, builds a modern four-bedroom home, and sells it before anyone moves in. Despite being on the same land as an old dwelling, the new house qualifies as a "new dwelling" for FIRB purposes.

### What is an "Established Dwelling"?

An established dwelling is simply: **any dwelling that is NOT a new dwelling**.

This includes:

❌ **Existing Houses**
- Any house previously lived in
- Properties sold on the secondary market
- Homes purchased from private sellers

❌ **Second-Hand Apartments**
- Units previously owned and occupied
- Apartments purchased from other owners (not developer)
- Any "used" residential property

❌ **Townhouses and Duplexes**
- If previously occupied or sold
- On the secondary market

❌ **Substantially Renovated BUT Occupied 12+ Months**
- Even if recently renovated
- If been lived in more than 12 months since completion
- No longer qualifies as "new"

**The key test:** Has the dwelling been previously sold as a place to live, or has it been occupied as a home?

If yes to either → Established dwelling
If no to both → New dwelling

### Grey Areas and Special Cases

**What about properties sold by developer but previously occupied?**
If an apartment in a building was completed 2 years ago and someone has lived in it, it's established—even if the developer still owns unsold units in the same building. Each unit is assessed individually.

**What about display homes?**
If used ONLY for display purposes (not actual residential living), can qualify as new. But if someone actually lived in it, it becomes established.

**What about commercial properties converted to residential?**
If converting commercial to residential and never previously used as a dwelling, can qualify as new. Complex rules apply—seek specialist advice.

## Current FIRB Rules: The Game-Changing Difference

This is where new and established properties diverge dramatically for foreign buyers.

### FIRB Rules for New Dwellings

**Who Can Buy:**
- ✅ Foreign nationals (non-residents)
- ✅ Temporary residents (all visa types)
- ✅ Anyone classified as a "foreign person"

**Requirements:**
- **FIRB approval required** for each purchase
- **No limit** on number of properties
- Can buy for **investment** OR **owner-occupation**
- **Application fee** based on property value ($15,100 to $1.2M+)

**Why it's allowed:**
The Australian government actively encourages foreign investment in new dwellings because it:
- Increases housing stock
- Creates construction jobs
- Stimulates economic activity
- Doesn't reduce availability for Australian buyers

**Process:**
1. Find suitable new dwelling
2. Apply for FIRB approval (or check developer exemption certificate)
3. Pay FIRB application fee
4. Wait for approval (typically 30 days)
5. Proceed with purchase

**Developer Exemption Certificates:**
Many developers obtain exemption certificates for their projects. If buying from such a developer:
- You don't need individual FIRB approval
- Still must notify ATO within 30 days of purchase
- Significantly streamlines the process
- Same fees apply (collected by developer)

### FIRB Rules for Established Dwellings

**⚠️ CRITICAL: TEMPORARY BAN IN EFFECT**

**From April 1, 2025 to March 31, 2027:**

**Who CANNOT Buy:**
- ❌ Foreign nationals
- ❌ Temporary residents (including students, 482 visa holders, all others)
- ❌ Foreign-owned companies
- ❌ Foreign trusts

**This means:**
- Cannot purchase ANY established dwelling
- Even if you want to live in it as primary residence
- Even if you're a temporary resident who previously could buy one
- Applies across all of Australia

**Very Limited Exceptions:**

Only these specific categories can potentially purchase established dwellings:

**1. Large-Scale Redevelopment Projects**
- Must increase housing stock by at least **20 additional dwellings**
- Requires comprehensive redevelopment application
- Must demonstrate genuine intent and capability
- Not suitable for typical residential purchases

**2. Build-to-Rent Developments**
- Must meet specific BTR criteria
- Minimum number of dwellings
- Long-term rental requirements
- Commercial-scale projects only

**3. Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme**
- Properties for seasonal workers
- Very specific circumstances
- Limited applicability

**None of these exceptions apply to regular foreign buyers wanting to purchase a home or investment property.**

### Historical Context (Pre-April 2025)

Understanding the old rules helps with future planning:

**Temporary Residents (Before the Ban):**
- Could purchase **one** established dwelling
- Must be used as **primary residence**
- Had to **sell within 3 months** of:
  - Moving out, OR
  - Visa expiring, OR
  - Leaving Australia
- Could NOT be used as investment
- Could NOT rent it out

**Non-Resident Foreign Persons (Before the Ban):**
- Generally could NOT purchase established dwellings
- Very limited exceptions existed
- Focused on new dwellings and vacant land

**Post-March 2027:**
The government will review the ban. Rules may:
- Return to pre-April 2025 status
- Continue the ban
- Implement modified restrictions

**Strategic implication:** Foreign buyers should monitor policy announcements in late 2026/early 2027 if interested in established dwellings.

## Cost Comparison: The True Price Difference

Beyond the purchase price, new and established properties carry different cost structures. Understanding these is crucial for accurate investment analysis.

### Purchase Costs Comparison

Let's compare a $800,000 property purchase in NSW:

| Cost Item | New Dwelling | Established Dwelling* |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Property Price** | $800,000 | $800,000 |
| **Stamp Duty (NSW)** | ~$31,090 | ~$31,090 |
| **Foreign Buyer Surcharge** | $72,000 (9%) | $72,000 (9%) |
| **FIRB Application Fee** | $30,300 | $45,300 (tripled rate) |
| **Building Inspection** | Often N/A (new construction warranty) | $600-$1,000 |
| **Pest Inspection** | Often N/A | $300-$500 |
| **Legal/Conveyancing** | $2,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$3,000 |
| **Mortgage Registration** | ~$150 | ~$150 |
| **Transfer Fees** | ~$200 | ~$200 |
| **TOTAL UPFRONT** | **~$935,740** | **~$951,740** |

*Note: Established dwellings currently banned for foreign buyers. Figures shown for comparison purposes only.

**Key observations:**

**1. FIRB Fees are Tripled for Established Dwellings**
When permitted, established dwelling FIRB fees are 3x higher:
- $800K property: $30,300 vs $45,300 (15K difference)
- $2M property: $90,900 vs $181,800 ($90K difference)

**2. Inspection Costs Only Apply to Established**
New dwellings come with construction warranties, eliminating need for pre-purchase inspections.

**3. GST Considerations**
- New dwellings: Purchase price may include GST
- Established dwellings: No GST on the sale itself
- Can affect loan calculations and deductibility

### Ongoing Holding Costs

After purchase, ownership costs differ significantly:

| Cost Category | New Dwelling | Established Dwelling |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Strata Fees** | $3,000-6,000/year | $2,500-5,000/year* |
| **Council Rates** | Similar | Similar |
| **Land Tax** | Same calculation | Same calculation |
| **Foreign Land Tax Surcharge** | Applies equally | Applies equally |
| **Maintenance** | Minimal first 5-10 years | $2,000-5,000+/year |
| **Insurance** | Lower (new = less risk) | Higher (age = more risk) |
| **Vacancy Fee** | If vacant 183+ days | If vacant 183+ days |

*Established strata fees often lower as building already amortized sinking fund contributions.

**Maintenance differences are significant:**

**New dwelling (Years 1-10):**
- Builder's warranty covers major defects
- Minimal maintenance required
- Modern, efficient systems
- **Estimated: $500-1,500/year**

**Established dwelling (Varies by age):**
- Hot water system replacements ($1,500-3,000)
- Appliance repairs/replacements
- Painting, repairs, wear and tear
- **Estimated: $2,000-5,000+/year**

**Over 10 years:**
- New dwelling maintenance: ~$10,000
- Established dwelling maintenance: ~$35,000
- **Difference: $25,000**

### Tax Deductions: A Key Advantage for New

This is where new dwellings offer significant advantages for investors.

**Depreciation Benefits:**

**New Dwelling:**
- **Building depreciation:** 2.5% per year for 40 years
  - $800K property, ~$300K building value
  - Depreciation: ~$7,500/year
- **Fixtures & fittings:** Much higher for new
  - Carpet, blinds, appliances, air con
  - Estimated additional: $3,000-5,000/year
- **Total annual depreciation: $10,500-12,500**
- **Over 10 years: $105,000-125,000 in deductions**

**Established Dwelling (Built pre-1987):**
- **No building depreciation** (if built before Sept 1987)
- **Limited fixtures depreciation** (existing items already depreciated)
- **Total annual depreciation: $0-2,000**
- **Over 10 years: $0-20,000 in deductions**

**Established Dwelling (Built post-1987):**
- **Building depreciation:** Remaining portion only
- **Fixtures depreciation:** Limited to newer items
- **Total annual depreciation: $3,000-6,000**
- **Over 10 years: $30,000-60,000**

**Tax savings (at 45% marginal rate + 2% Medicare levy):**

- New dwelling: ~$49,350-58,750 over 10 years
- Established (post-1987): ~$14,100-28,200 over 10 years
- Established (pre-1987): ~$0-9,400 over 10 years

**Difference: $30,000-50,000+ over 10 years**

## Investment Potential: Returns and Growth Analysis

Let's analyze the investment case for each property type.

### Capital Growth Potential

**Typical growth rate:** 4-6% annually, with higher volatility

### Rental Yield Comparison

**Established Dwellings:**

**Advantages:**
- Proven rental history in area
- Established tenant demand
- Often closer to employment centers

**Yields:**
- Inner established suburbs: 2.5-3.5%

- **Mitigation:** Research builder, understand warranty, budget for potential issues

**Established Dwelling Risks:**

**1. Maintenance and Unexpected Repairs**
- Hidden structural issues
- Aging infrastructure requiring replacement
- Expensive surprises (plumbing, electrical, roofing)
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive inspections, maintenance reserve fund

**2. Limited Foreign Buyer Market**
- Cannot sell to foreign buyers (currently)
- Reduces potential buyer pool
- May affect resale value
- **Mitigation:** Buy in areas with strong domestic demand

**3. Rental Property Condition**
- May need updating to attract tenants
- Renovation costs to maintain competitiveness
- Tenant expectations rising toward newer properties
- **Mitigation:** Budget for periodic updates, choose well-maintained properties

**4. Energy Efficiency**
- Higher utility costs affect tenant appeal
- May need to upgrade to remain competitive
- Environmental regulations tightening
- **Mitigation:** Choose properties with good energy ratings, budget for efficiency upgrades

## Financing Considerations

How easy is it to get a mortgage for each property type?

### New Dwelling Financing

**Advantages:**
- Banks generally prefer new properties
- Lower loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions
- May accept pre-sale contract for pre-approval
- Developer often has relationship with specific lenders

**Typical terms for foreign buyers:**
- LVR: 60-70% (30-40% deposit)
- Interest rates: 6.5-8.0%
- Loan term: 20-30 years

**Challenges:**
- Bank valuation may come in low for off-the-plan
- May need to cover gap between contract price and valuation
- Construction loans different from standard mortgages (if land + build)

### Established Dwelling Financing

**Advantages:**
- Property already exists (certain valuation)
- Immediate rental income starts
- No completion risk

**Typical terms for foreign buyers:**
- LVR: 60-70% (30-40% deposit)
- Interest rates: 6.5-8.0%
- Loan term: 20-30 years

**Challenges:**
- Limited lenders willing to finance foreign buyers
- Stricter serviceability requirements
- May require larger deposit if older property

### Practical Financing Tip

Many foreign buyers find:
- **New dwellings:** Easier approval process, better lender options
- **Established dwellings:** More conservative lending, fewer willing lenders

If financing is crucial to your purchase, new dwellings typically provide smoother path.

## Strategic Recommendations by Investor Type

Different investors should favor different property types based on their goals and constraints.

### Profile 1: Student Visa Holder (3-4 Year Timeframe)

**Recommended: New Dwelling (Off-the-Plan Apartment)**

**Why:**
- Only option during current ban
- Depreciation benefits maximize tax returns
- Low maintenance while studying
- Can sell to other foreign buyers when leaving

**Location strategy:**
- Near university
- Good public transport
- Rental demand from other students

**Example:**
Buy 2-bed apartment near University of Melbourne for $550,000. Live in one room, rent the other to fellow student. Depreciation offsets rental income tax. Sell to another foreign buyer after graduation.

### Profile 2: Temporary Skilled Worker (Long-term, PR Pathway)

**Recommended: New Dwelling in Growth Corridor OR Wait for PR**

**Why:**
- If PR expected within 1-2 years, waiting eliminates FIRB restrictions
- If buying now, new dwelling offers flexibility
- Growth corridor provides capital appreciation potential
- Can retain as investment after getting PR

**Location strategy:**
- Areas with infrastructure investment
- Future transport links
- Master-planned communities

**Example:**
482 visa holder expecting PR in 18 months. Buy house-and-land package in outer Melbourne growth corridor for $650,000. Rent out until PR granted, then decide whether to live in or retain as investment.

### Profile 3: Foreign National (Offshore Investor)

**Recommended: New Dwelling - Strategic Portfolio Approach**

**Why:**
- Only option currently available
- Depreciation maximizes returns
- Professional property management essential
- Build diversified portfolio over time

**Location strategy:**
- Proven rental markets
- Near employment centers
- Transport accessibility
- Minimal oversupply risk

**Example:**
Hong Kong-based investor builds portfolio of 3 new apartments over 5 years: Sydney CBD ($750K), Melbourne Southbank ($680K), Brisbane Fortitude Valley ($520K). Professional management, depreciation benefits, geographic diversification.

### Profile 4: High Net Worth Investor (Premium Market)

**Recommended: New Dwellings in Prestige Developments**

**Why:**
- Access to premium locations via new luxury developments
- Top-quality finishes and amenities
- Attracts executive tenants
- Strong resale potential

**Location strategy:**
- Waterfront developments
- CBD prestige towers
- Master-planned estates
- Golf course communities

**Example:**
Ultra-high-net-worth investor purchases $2.5M penthouse in new Sydney Harbour development. Premium rental to executive tenants. Holds for 10+ years for long-term capital appreciation.

### Profile 5: Family Planning Migration

**Recommended: New House-and-Land (Owner-Occupation Focus)**

**Why:**
- Suitable for family living
- Can move in immediately upon migration
- Modern, low-maintenance
- School proximity crucial

**Location strategy:**
- Good school zones
- Family-friendly suburbs
- Parks and amenities
- Chinese/Asian communities (if preferred)

**Example:**
Family planning migration in 2 years buys new 4-bed house in Chatswood (Sydney) for $1.4M. Rent out short-term until migration. Move in with family upon arrival. No need to sell (unlike established dwelling restrictions).

## Making Your Decision: A Practical Framework

Use this decision tree to determine which property type suits you:

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

**Are you a foreign person?**
- **No** (Australian citizen/PR) → Can buy either, skip to Step 3
- **Yes** → Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Current FIRB Reality Check

**Can you legally purchase established dwellings?**
- **No** (April 2025 - March 2027 ban applies) → **Must choose new dwelling**
- **Yes** (after ban ends, or qualifying exception) → Continue to Step 3

### Step 3: Investment Horizon

**How long do you plan to hold?**

**Less than 5 years:**
- **Risk:** New dwellings may not appreciate significantly
- **Better choice:** Established in proven location (if available)
- **Reality check:** Capital growth limited in short term for new

**5-10 years:**
- **Either option viable**
- New dwelling depreciation benefits valuable
- Established location advantage matters

**10+ years:**
- **New dwellings catch up** on capital appreciation
- Tax benefits compound
- Less maintenance means lower costs

### Step 4: Tax Strategy

**Is maximizing tax deductions important?**

**Yes, need strong deductions:**
- **Clear winner: New dwelling**
- Depreciation provides $10,000-15,000+ annual deductions
- Significantly improves after-tax returns

**No, not concerned about tax:**
- **Established dwelling more attractive** (when permitted)
- Focus on land value and location

### Step 5: Risk Tolerance

**How do you feel about development risk?**

**Low risk tolerance:**
- Avoid off-the-plan
- Consider completed new dwellings only
- Or established property in proven location

**Moderate risk tolerance:**
- Off-the-plan from established developers acceptable
- Research track record carefully
- Include protective clauses

**High risk tolerance:**
- Off-the-plan in emerging areas
- Potential for higher returns
- Accept volatility

### Step 6: Financing Requirements

**Do you need a mortgage?**

**Yes, financing crucial:**
- **New dwellings** generally easier for foreign buyers
- More lenders willing to finance
- Better LVR availability

**No, cash purchase:**
- Financing not a differentiator
- Focus on investment merit

## Real-World Examples: Learning from Others

3. House-and-land, Sydney growth corridor ($820,000 - purchased 2023)

**Total invested:** $1.95M
**Current value:** $2.45M (+25% overall)
**Combined rental: $95,000/year (4.8% gross yield)**

**Strategy benefits:**
- Geographic diversification
- All new dwellings (maximum depreciation)
- Professional management across all properties
- No forced sales (not temporary resident)
- Building wealth in multiple markets

**Key learnings:**
- Spread risk across cities and property types
- New dwelling strategy provided consistency
- Tax benefits substantial across portfolio
- Would continue similar approach

## Common Questions Answered

**Q: Is off-the-plan always a bad idea?**

A: No, but requires careful selection. Look for:
- Established developer with good track record
- Limited competing supply in area
- Strong underlying demand fundamentals
- Reasonable pricing compared to completed comparables
- Protective contract clauses

Many successful investors use off-the-plan strategically, especially in supply-constrained areas with strong demand.

**Q: Can I renovate an established property to make it "new"?**

A: Potentially, but it's complex:
- Must be "substantially renovated"
- Cannot be occupied for 12+ months after renovation
- FIRB may scrutinize the claim
- Typically not worth it for most investors
- Simpler to buy genuine new dwelling

**Q: What happens to my new dwelling after 10 years—does it become established?**

A: For FIRB purposes:
- A property sold as "new" remains treated as such
- Future sales (you selling it later) would be as "established"
- But by then, if you have PR, FIRB doesn't matter
- Focus on investment merit at that point

**Q: Should I wait until the established dwelling ban ends to buy?**

A: Depends on your situation:
- If you want established property specifically: Maybe
- But waiting means:
  - Missing 2+ years of potential growth
  - Missing tax benefits (if investing)
  - No certainty ban will end
  - Rules might not return to previous status
  
For most foreign buyers, purchasing available new dwellings now is the better strategy.

**Q: Are new apartments always in oversupplied areas?**

A: No, but common issue in some markets:
- Research planned supply in area
- Check current rental vacancy rates
- Assess underlying demand drivers
- Avoid areas with 5+ new towers simultaneously marketing

Many new developments in supply-constrained locations offer excellent opportunities.
