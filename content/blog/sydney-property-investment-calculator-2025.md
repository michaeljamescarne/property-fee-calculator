### Critical Cost Observations for Foreign Buyers

**1. Foreign Buyer Surcharge Has Increased**

- Now 9% (up from 8% before January 1, 2025)
- On $1M property: $90,000 additional cost
- On $2M property: $180,000 additional cost
- **This is pure cost—generates no benefit**

**2. Foreign Owner Land Tax Surcharge is Substantial**

- 2% annually on land value (in addition to base land tax)
- On $1.6M land value: $32,000 per year
- Over 10 years: $320,000+
- **Compounds significantly over holding period**

**3. Upfront Costs Typically 15-16% of Purchase Price**

- Budget minimum $150,000 additional for $1M property
- Budget minimum $300,000 additional for $2M property
- Often underestimated by first-time foreign investors

**4. Cash Flow Often Negative in Early Years**

- Especially in high-value suburbs
- Requires ongoing funding capacity
- Improves over time as rents rise

**5. Depreciation Benefits Favor New Dwellings**

- Example 1 (new apartment): ~$12,000/year depreciation available
- Example 2 (established house): ~$2,000/year depreciation
- **Difference: $10,000/year or $100,000 over 10 years**

- Olympic Park: Large supply pipeline
- Some Parramatta precincts: Multiple towers

**Mitigation:**

- Research supply pipeline before purchase
- Check current vacancy rates (target under 3%)
- Avoid areas with 3+ large developments simultaneously
- Prefer established apartment markets

**2. Strata Defects in New Buildings**

**Reality in Sydney:**

- Construction quality issues common 2015-2020
- Major defects in several high-profile buildings
- Rectification costs borne by owners
- Can significantly impact values

**Mitigation:**

- Research developer track record thoroughly
- Check building certifier history
- Review owners corporation minutes
- Consider established buildings over 5 years old
- Budget for potential defect contributions

**3. Strata Levy Increases**

**Common issue:**

- New buildings often have artificially low initial levies
- Sinking fund contributions increase significantly
- Special levies for major works
- Year 5-10 often sees 50-100% levy increases

**Mitigation:**

- Review strata report carefully
- Check sinking fund balance adequacy
- Research building's likely 10-year requirements
- Budget conservatively

**4. Premium Property Cycle Sensitivity**

**Observation:**

- Premium suburbs ($2M+) more volatile
- Suffer larger declines in downturns
- Take longer to recover
- Interest rate sensitive

**Mitigation:**

- Longer investment horizon (15+ years)
- Strong financial buffer
- Avoid leverage in premium segment
- Accept volatility for long-term gain

### Regulatory Risks

**5. FIRB Rule Changes**

**Historical pattern:**

- Rules tighten during hot markets
- Fees increase regularly (indexed + policy)
- Eligibility restrictions expanded
- Established dwelling ban demonstrates this

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on new dwellings (less policy risk)
- Stay informed on policy changes
- Build relationships with specialists
- Maintain flexibility in strategy

**6. Foreign Buyer Surcharge Increases**

**Trend:**

- NSW: 4% → 8% → 9% (over 10 years)
- Land tax: 0.75% → 2% → 2% (over 10 years)
- Ongoing increases likely
- Can significantly impact returns

**Mitigation:**

- Factor increasing costs into projections
- Build margin of safety in returns
- Consider permanent residency pathway
- Don't assume current rates will persist
