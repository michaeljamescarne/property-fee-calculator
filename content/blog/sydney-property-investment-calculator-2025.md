- Over 10 years: $320,000+

- Often underestimated by first-time foreign investors

**4. Cash Flow Often Negative in Early Years**

- Zetland: High concentration of new stock
- Olympic Park: Large supply pipeline
- Some Parramatta precincts: Multiple towers

**Mitigation:**
- Research supply pipeline before purchase
- Check current vacancy rates (target under 3%)

- Prefer established apartment markets

**2. Strata Defects in New Buildings**

**Reality in Sydney:**
- Construction quality issues common 2015-2020

- Budget for potential defect contributions

**3. Strata Levy Increases**

**Common issue:**
- New buildings often have artificially low initial levies

**Mitigation:**

- Build relationships with specialists
- Maintain flexibility in strategy

**6. Foreign Buyer Surcharge Increases**

**Trend:**
- NSW: 4% → 8% → 9% (over 10 years)

- Ongoing increases likely
- Can significantly impact returns

**Mitigation:**

- Property management fees
- Vacancy allowance
- Strata fees (if apartment)
- Council rates
- Water rates
- Land tax (base + foreign surcharge)
- Insurance
- Maintenance/repairs
- Mortgage interest (if applicable)
= Annual Cash Flow (usually negative early years)
```

**Tax Benefits (if applicable):**
```
+ Depreciation deductions (buildings + fixtures)
+ Interest deductions (if loan)
+ Other deductible expenses
× Your marginal tax rate
= Tax Savings
```

**Capital Growth:**
```
Final property value
- Purchase price
- Selling costs (agent ~2%, legal ~$2K)
- Capital Gains Tax (~47% for foreign residents on gain)
= Net Capital Gain
```

**True ROI Calculation:**
```
(Net Capital Gain + Cumulative Cash Flow + Tax Savings - All Costs)
÷ Total Capital Invested
= Total Return %

Then ÷ Number of Years = Average Annual Return %
```

### Sample 10-Year ROI Calculation

**Burwood Apartment - $1M Purchase**

**Total Capital Invested:** $1,149,440

**Cumulative Cash Flow (10 years):** -$25,000 (negative early, positive later)

**Tax Savings (10 years):** ~$55,000 (depreciation benefits)

**Capital Gain:**
- Sale price (Year 10): $1,630,000 (5% annual growth)
- Less: Selling costs: ~$35,000
- Gross gain: $595,000
- Less: CGT (47%): ~$280,000
- **Net capital gain:** $315,000

**Total Return:**
```
$315,000 (capital gain)
- $25,000 (negative cash flow)
+ $55,000 (tax savings)
= $345,000 total return
```

**ROI:**
```
$345,000 ÷ $1,149,440 = 30.0% total return
30.0% ÷ 10 years = 3.0% average annual return
```

**This is the TRUE return** - not the property growth rate (5%), but your actual return on capital invested (3%).

The difference? All those costs and taxes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I invest in Sydney or Melbourne as a foreign buyer?**

A: Sydney offers:
- Stronger long-term capital growth (7%+ vs 6%+)
- Better international liquidity
- More limited supply = higher prices but better growth

Melbourne offers:
- Lower entry prices
- Higher rental yields
- More affordable for first-time investors

**Choice depends on your budget and priorities.** High-net-worth → Sydney. Value-focused → Melbourne.

**Q: What's the minimum realistic budget for Sydney property as a foreign buyer?**

A: Budget at least $700K total investment:
- $550-600K property price (outer suburbs/apartments)
- $150K additional for all costs
- Anything less severely limits options

More realistic budget for quality: $900K-1.2M total.

**Q: How much cash flow should I expect?**

A: Be realistic:
- Years 1-3: Negative $2,000-5,000/year typical
- Years 4-7: Breakeven to slight positive
- Years 8-10: Positive $3,000-8,000/year
- Requires ongoing funding capacity

Sydney is capital growth focused, not cash flow.

**Q: Should I use a buyer's agent?**

A: Strong yes if:
- First-time foreign investor
- Not familiar with Sydney
- Living overseas
- Want access to off-market properties
- Value professional guidance

Cost (2% of price) often recovered through better purchase.

**Q: Can I get a mortgage as a temporary resident?**

A: Yes, but challenging:
- Need 30-40% deposit minimum
- Higher interest rates (6.5-8%)
- Limited lender options
- Strict income verification

Many temporary residents opt for cash purchase to avoid complexity.

**Q: What happens if the property value drops?**

A: Short-term volatility normal:
- Sydney corrections typically 5-15%
- Recovery usually 2-3 years
- Long-term trend is upward
- Don't sell in down market
- Ensure you can hold through cycles

**Q: Should I buy new or established?**

A: For foreign buyers currently:
- **Must buy new** (established banned April 2025 - March 2027)
- New offers depreciation benefits
- Established better locations (when ban lifts)

See our [New vs Established Guide] for full comparison.

**Q: How hands-on do I need to be?**

A: With good property manager:
- Monthly: Review statements (30 min)
- Quarterly: Manager reports (1 hour)
- Annually: Tax preparation (3-4 hours)
- Ad-hoc: Major repairs/issues

Total: 10-15 hours/year for well-managed property.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sydney offers strong long-term growth** (7%+ annually historically) but requires patience and significant capital

2. **True cost for foreign buyers is 15-16% above purchase price** - budget $150K+ extra for $1M property

3. **Foreign buyer surcharge is now 9%** (increased January 1, 2025) and foreign land tax surcharge is 2% annually

4. **Cash flow typically negative for first 3-5 years** in Sydney - ensure ongoing funding capacity

7. **New dwellings offer significant tax advantages** - $10-15K/year depreciation vs $0-2K for established

8. **True ROI typically 3-4% annually** after all costs and taxes - not the headline 5-7% property growth

10. **Long-term horizon required** - minimum 7-10 years to realize solid returns, ideally 15+ years
