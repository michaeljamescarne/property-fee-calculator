# Brisbane Property Investment Guide for Foreign Buyers (2025)

_Last updated: 28 December 2024 • 10 min read_

Brisbane is having a moment. With the 2032 Olympics on the horizon, billions being poured into infrastructure, and property prices still sitting well below Sydney and Melbourne, Queensland's capital has become one of Australia's hottest investment destinations. But for foreign buyers, navigating the costs, regulations, and opportunities requires careful planning.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about investing in Brisbane property as a foreign buyer in 2025.

## Why Foreign Investors Are Choosing Brisbane

Brisbane's appeal isn't just about being more affordable than Australia's southern capitals—though that certainly helps. The city is undergoing a transformation that's reshaping its investment landscape.

**Major infrastructure projects** like the $5.4 billion Cross River Rail, Brisbane Metro, and the $3.6 billion Queen's Wharf precinct are redefining connectivity and lifestyle. These aren't just construction projects; they're catalysts for long-term property value growth in surrounding suburbs.

The **2032 Olympic Games** will bring unprecedented global attention and investment. History shows that Olympic host cities typically see significant property value increases in the lead-up years, and Brisbane is already experiencing this effect.

From an investment perspective, Brisbane offers **higher rental yields** than Sydney or Melbourne (often 4-5% compared to 2-3%), while still providing strong capital growth potential. The city's population is growing rapidly—projected to reach 3.6 million by 2031—creating sustained demand for housing.

And let's not forget lifestyle. Brisbane's subtropical climate, proximity to beaches, and more relaxed pace of life make it highly attractive to renters and future residents.

## Understanding the Full Cost Picture

Foreign property investment in Brisbane involves multiple layers of costs beyond the purchase price. Here's what you'll actually pay:

### FIRB Application Fees

Before you can buy any Australian property, you need approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). This isn't optional—it's a legal requirement.

Application fees are tiered based on property value. For a property valued up to $1 million, you'll pay $15,100. The fee increases progressively for more expensive properties. Budget for this as part of your initial investment capital, as you'll need to pay it before settlement.

### Stamp Duty: The Biggest Upfront Cost

Queensland's stamp duty structure includes two components for foreign buyers:

**Standard transfer duty** is calculated on a sliding scale. For a typical investment property, you're looking at rates between 3.5% and 5.75% depending on the purchase price.

**Foreign acquirer duty** adds an additional 7% to the total property value. This is a flat rate surcharge specifically for foreign purchasers.

Let's look at a real example: On a $700,000 Brisbane apartment, you would pay approximately $24,350 in standard stamp duty plus $49,000 in foreign acquirer duty—a total of $73,350 just in transfer taxes.

This makes stamp duty often the second-largest cost after your deposit, so it's crucial to factor it into your budget from day one.

### Ongoing Land Tax

Queensland levies annual land tax on investment properties above certain value thresholds. As a foreign owner, you'll pay the standard land tax rate plus an **absentee owner surcharge of 2%** of your land's taxable value.

This applies every year you own the property, not just once. For a $700,000 property where the land value is $300,000, this surcharge alone would be $6,000 annually, on top of any regular land tax owed.

### Professional Fees and Other Costs

- **Conveyancing and legal fees**: $1,500–$3,000 for handling the property transfer and legal documentation
- **Building and pest inspections**: $400–$600 (highly recommended before purchase)
- **Loan application and establishment fees**: $600–$1,200 if financing through an Australian lender
- **Lenders Mortgage Insurance**: Often required for foreign buyers, potentially $10,000+ depending on your deposit size
- **Property management fees**: 7–9% of rental income plus leasing fees if you're renting out the property

## FIRB Regulations: What You Can Actually Buy

Understanding what you're permitted to purchase is crucial to avoid wasting time and application fees on ineligible properties.

### New vs. Established Properties

**New dwellings** (never been lived in or substantially renovated) are generally approved for foreign investors. This includes off-the-plan apartments, newly built houses, and house-and-land packages.

**Established properties** (existing homes) are typically off-limits to non-resident foreign buyers. There are limited exceptions for temporary residents who need a primary residence, but these come with strict conditions including a requirement to sell when you leave Australia.

### Critical: The Temporary Prohibition (2025-2027)

This is important: **From April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2027, the Australian government has implemented a temporary ban** on foreign persons purchasing established dwellings. This includes temporary residents who previously could buy one established home.

During this two-year period, FIRB will generally not approve applications for established residential property purchases by foreign investors. This policy aims to improve housing availability for Australian residents during a period of housing shortage.

**What this means for you**: Focus exclusively on new developments, off-the-plan purchases, or vacant land. Established properties are effectively off the table until at least April 2027.

## Where to Invest: Brisbane's Opportunity Zones

Location strategy matters enormously for foreign investors, especially when you can't inspect properties in person regularly.

### Inner-City Apartments

Suburbs like **South Brisbane, West End, Fortitude Valley**, and **Newstead** offer strong rental demand from young professionals and students. These areas benefit from proximity to the CBD, universities, and entertainment precincts.

Expect yields around 4.5-5.5% but focus on developments near the new Cross River Rail stations, as these will see the biggest connectivity improvements.

### Growth Corridors

The **northern corridor** (Moreton Bay region including North Lakes, Mango Hill) and **southern corridor** (Logan area) offer more affordable house-and-land packages with strong population growth.

These areas typically offer better land-to-total-value ratios, which is important for long-term capital growth. They're also where many new dwelling approvals are concentrated—meaning plenty of FIRB-eligible options.

### Olympic Precinct Opportunities

Properties near future Olympic venues—particularly around **Brisbane Arena (South Brisbane)**, **Gabba redevelopment**, and **Chandler** in the eastern suburbs—are likely to benefit from infrastructure investment and increased global exposure.

These areas may offer a sweet spot: established infrastructure meeting new development opportunities.

## Making the Numbers Work

Successful foreign property investment requires understanding your complete financial picture over time, not just the purchase price.

Consider a typical $650,000 Brisbane apartment purchase:

**Upfront investment:**

- Deposit (typically 20% for foreign buyers): $130,000
- FIRB application fee: $15,100
- Stamp duty (standard + foreign surcharge): $68,500
- Legal and conveyancing: $2,500
- Total cash needed at purchase: ~$216,100

**Annual ongoing costs:**

- Land tax and surcharge: ~$4,800
- Council rates: ~$1,600
- Strata fees: ~$4,500
- Insurance: ~$1,200
- Property management (7% of $32,500 rent): ~$2,275
- Maintenance (1% of value): ~$6,500
- Total annual costs: ~$20,875

**Annual income:**

- Rental income (5% yield): $32,500
- Net cash flow: ~$11,625 positive

This is simplified, but it shows why doing detailed calculations for your specific situation is essential before committing.

## Tax Implications to Consider

Foreign property investors in Australia face several tax obligations:

- **Rental income** is taxable in Australia (you'll need an Australian tax file number)
- **Capital gains tax** applies when you sell (currently 30% for foreign residents, with no 50% discount)
- **Withholding tax** on rental income may apply depending on your residency status
- **Departure prohibition** may require you to obtain a clearance certificate when selling

Work with an accountant experienced in cross-border property taxation—the rules are complex and mistakes can be expensive.

## Financing as a Foreign Buyer

Securing finance as a non-resident is more challenging than for Australian citizens or permanent residents. Most banks require:

- **Larger deposits**: 30-40% is common (vs. 20% for residents)
- **Higher interest rates**: Often 0.5-1% above standard rates
- **Stricter serviceability tests**: Your income and expenses will be scrutinized closely
- **Limited lender options**: Not all Australian banks lend to foreign buyers

Some foreign investors choose to fund purchases through equity in their home country or via specialized foreign buyer mortgage brokers who work with the limited lender panel that accepts non-resident applications.

## Your Investment Checklist

Before committing to a Brisbane property investment:

✅ Verify you can obtain FIRB approval for your chosen property type

✅ Project 10-year cash flow including all ongoing costs  
✅ Research the specific suburb's growth drivers and risks  
✅ Engage a buyer's agent if you can't inspect personally  
✅ Arrange pre-approval for finance if borrowing

## Final Thoughts

Brisbane offers compelling opportunities for foreign property investors who understand the regulatory landscape and cost structure. The combination of major infrastructure investment, Olympic momentum, and relative affordability creates a favorable environment for long-term capital growth.

However, success requires careful financial planning. The upfront costs—particularly the 7% foreign acquirer duty—mean you need significant capital beyond the deposit. And the temporary ban on established properties limits your options until 2027.

Do your due diligence, run the numbers thoroughly, and seek professional advice from Australian property tax specialists and qualified financial advisors. With the right property in the right location at the right price, Brisbane can deliver strong returns for patient, well-prepared investors.
