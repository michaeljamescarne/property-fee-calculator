# Build-to-Rent Australia 2025: Complete Guide to FIRB Fee & Tax Concessions for Foreign Investors

_Last Updated: December 2025_

Build-to-Rent (BTR) developments offer the most generous concessions in Australia's foreign investment framework. With FIRB fee reductions of up to 98%, reduced withholding taxes, and state tax exemptions, BTR is one of the most attractive pathways for foreign capital in Australian property.

## Quick Summary: Why BTR Gets Massive Concessions

**FIRB Fee Savings:**

- $10M acquisition: From $818,100 → $15,100 (98% reduction)
- $40M acquisition: From $3,545,100 → $63,900 (98% reduction)

**Tax Benefits:**

- MIT withholding tax: **15% instead of 30%**
- Capital works deduction: **4% instead of 2.5%** per year

**State Concessions:**

- 100% foreign purchaser duty exemption
- 100% foreign land tax surcharge exemption
- 50% land tax reduction (some states)

**Trade-off:** Must commit to 15 years, 50+ dwellings, 10% affordable housing

## What Are Build-to-Rent Developments?

BTR developments are large-scale residential buildings (50+ apartments) designed for long-term rental under single institutional ownership. Unlike "build-to-sell" apartments, BTR projects offer long-term leases (5+ years), professional management, and affordable housing components—addressing rental shortages while ensuring foreign investment increases supply rather than competing with homebuyers.

## FIRB Fee Concessions: Commercial Rates for BTR

**Effective:** 14 December 2023

Foreign investors in qualifying BTR projects pay **commercial land application fees** instead of residential rates—regardless of whether the land is classified as residential.

### Fee Comparison Table

| Property Value | Standard Residential Fee (2025-26) | BTR Commercial Fee (2025-26) | Savings          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| $5 million     | $363,600                           | $15,100                      | $348,500 (96%)   |
| $10 million    | $818,100                           | $15,100                      | $803,000 (98%)   |
| $20 million    | $1,727,100                         | $28,200                      | $1,698,900 (98%) |
| $40 million    | $3,545,100                         | $63,900                      | $3,481,200 (98%) |
| $100 million   | $3,615,600                         | $243,900                     | $3,371,700 (93%) |

**Important:** You must explicitly request concessional BTR fee treatment in your FIRB application.

## Federal Tax Concessions for BTR

### 1. Reduced MIT Withholding Tax: 15% vs 30%

Foreign investors typically pay 30% withholding tax on MIT distributions. For BTR, this drops to **15%** on rental income and capital gains.

**Applies to:** Foreign residents from information exchange countries (US, UK, Singapore, Canada, Japan, Germany, China, Hong Kong, India, and 70+ others)

**Annual savings example:** $2M distribution = $300K saved (continues indefinitely beyond 15 years)

### 2. Accelerated Capital Works Deductions

BTR gets **4% annually** vs standard 2.5% on construction costs.

**Important:** The 4% rate only applies to construction that **commenced after 7:30 pm AEDT on 9 May 2023**. Projects that commenced before this date are not eligible for the accelerated rate.

**Savings example:** $80M construction = $1.2M additional annual deduction

## State & Territory Tax Concessions

### New South Wales

- **Land tax:** 50% reduction (indefinite from 2026)
- **Foreign purchaser surcharge duty (9%):** 100% exemption
- **Foreign owner land tax surcharge (5%):** 100% exemption until 2040

### Victoria

- **Land tax:** 50% reduction (up to 30 years)
- **Foreign purchaser surcharge duty (8%):** 100% exemption
- **Foreign owner land tax surcharge (4%):** 100% exemption (until 30 June 2050 or 20 years max)

### Queensland

- **Land tax:** 50% reduction (maximum 20 years)
- **Foreign purchaser surcharge duty (7%):** 100% exemption
- **Foreign owner land tax surcharge (2%):** 100% exemption

### Western Australia

- **Land tax:** 75% reduction for first 3 years, then 50% (max 20 years total)

### South Australia

- **Land tax:** 50% reduction in land value

## BTR Eligibility Requirements: What You Must Meet

To access these concessions, your BTR development must satisfy ALL of the following:

### 1. Minimum Scale

✅ At least **50 self-contained dwellings** (federal requirement for tax concessions)

**Note:** Western Australia's state land tax concession has a lower threshold of **40 dwellings**. Always check specific state requirements.

### 2. Ownership Structure

✅ Single entity ownership (can be tenants in common, but must collectively own all dwellings)

✅ Can be sold to another single entity and retain BTR status

✅ Must maintain structure for **15 years minimum**

### 3. Lease Terms

✅ Offer lease terms of **at least 5 years** to the general public (federal requirement)

✅ Tenants can request shorter terms, but 5-year options must be available

✅ No restrictions on tenancy agreements (except health/safety or affordable housing requirements)

**Important State Variations:**

- **Victoria:** Requires 3-year minimum lease offers (until 2026, then aligns with 5-year federal requirement)
- Most other states align with the 5-year federal requirement
- Always verify current state requirements when applying for state concessions

### 4. Affordable Housing Requirement

✅ **10% of dwellings** must be affordable housing

✅ Affordable = rented at **74.9% or less** of market rent for comparable dwellings

✅ Must include affordable options across all dwelling types (not just studios or 1-beds)

✅ At least **2% must be "lower-income dwellings"** (from 2025 expanded requirements)

✅ Must engage eligible Community Housing Provider (CHP) to identify tenants

### 5. Single Management Entity

✅ All leases, common areas, and facilities managed by one entity

✅ On-site management must be available for tenants

### 6. Property Type Restrictions

❌ NOT eligible: Student accommodation, land lease communities, retirement villages, hotels, motels, hostels, boarding houses

## Compliance Period & Reporting

### 15-Year Commitment

Once you elect for BTR status, you enter a **15-year compliance period** where all eligibility criteria must be continuously met.

### Notification Requirements

Notify the ATO within **28 days** of:

- Electing BTR status (Form NAT 75663)
- Ownership changes
- Ceasing to meet any eligibility criteria
- Selling or disposing of the development

### Ongoing Reporting

- **Quarterly reporting** on affordable housing compliance
- **Annual declaration** to state revenue offices (for state concessions)

### BTR Misuse Tax (The Penalty)

If you fail to meet eligibility criteria during the 15 years:

**Penalty = (All tax benefits claimed) + 8%**

This includes:

- Extra capital works deductions claimed
- Withholding tax savings received
- Plus 8% representing interest and costs

**This penalty is NOT tax deductible.**

## BTR Exception to Established Dwelling Ban

**Critical:** Despite the ban on foreign purchases of established dwellings (1 April 2025 - 31 March 2027), foreign investors **CAN purchase established BTR developments** that meet eligibility criteria.

Requirements:

- 50+ dwellings
- Continues operating as BTR
- Meets all standard BTR eligibility criteria

This makes BTR one of the **only ways** to acquire existing residential property during the ban period.

## Real-World Example: $50M BTR Development in Victoria

**Project Details:**

- Land: $20M, Construction: $30M
- 100 dwellings (10 affordable)
- Foreign investor via MIT structure

**Year 1 Savings:**

- FIRB fee: Save $1,698,900 ($1,727,100 residential → $28,200 commercial)
- Foreign purchaser duty: Save $1,600,000 (8% exemption)
- **Total upfront: $3,298,900**

**Annual Ongoing Savings (Years 1-20):**

- Foreign land tax surcharge: Save $800,000/year (4% exemption)
- MIT withholding tax: Save $400,000/year (15% vs 30% on $2.67M distribution)
- **Total annual: $1,200,000**

**Total 20-Year Savings: ~$27.3M**

Less compliance costs (~$300K over 15 years) = **Net benefit: ~$27M**

## Who Should Consider BTR?

**Ideal for:** Institutional investors (pension funds, REITs), long-term capital (15+ years), developers with 50+ dwelling scale, those seeking stable rental income

**Not suitable for:** Quick-exit investors, small developments (<50 units), projects unable to meet 10% affordable housing, short-term capital

2. **ATO Notification:** Lodge Form NAT 75663 within 28 days to elect BTR status

2. **Get Expert Advice:** FIRB specialists, tax advisors, legal counsel
3. **Engage CHPs Early:** Identify Community Housing Providers in planning phase
