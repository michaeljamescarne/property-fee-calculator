# Foreign Owner Land Tax Surcharges 2026: A State-by-State Guide

**Last Updated: January 2026**

Most foreign investors budget for the "big ticket" entry costs: the FIRB application fee and the stamp duty surcharge. But there's a third tax—often overlooked—that can silently erode your rental yield every single year.

It's the **Foreign Owner Land Tax Surcharge**.

Unlike stamp duty (which is a one-off payment), this surcharge is an **annual** tax levied on the unimproved land value of your property. In 2026, several states have increased these rates, meaning holding costs for foreign investors are higher than ever.

If you're buying property in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane, you can't afford to ignore this line item in your cash flow forecast.

### The "Silent Yield Killer"

Standard land tax is already a cost for most investors (local or foreign) once their land value exceeds a certain threshold.

However, the **Foreign Surcharge** is different:

1. **No threshold:** In most states (like NSW), the surcharge applies from the _first dollar_ of land value. Even a small apartment with a $200,000 land value gets taxed.
2. **Add-on cost:** It's calculated _in addition to_ standard land tax.
3. **Rate hikes:** NSW recently increased its rate to **5%**, and Victoria now sits at **4%**.

For a property with a land value of $1,000,000 in Sydney, the surcharge alone is **$50,000 per year**. That's $50,000 in pure holding costs, before you pay a cent in mortgage interest, council rates, or maintenance.

### 2026 Surcharge Rates by State

Here's the confirmed landscape for the 2026 land tax year.

| State   | Surcharge Rate (Annual) | Threshold | Notes                                                                         |
| :------ | :---------------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NSW** | **5.0%**                | $0        | The highest rate in the country. Applies from the first dollar of land value. |
| **VIC** | **4.0%**                | $0\*      | Applies to "Absentee Owners".                                                 |
| **QLD** | **3.0%**                | $350k\*   | Applies to foreign companies, trusts, and absentee individuals.               |
| **TAS** | **2.0%**                | $0        | Applies to "Foreign Investors".                                               |
| **ACT** | **0.75%**               | $0        | Calculated on Average Unimproved Value (AUV).                                 |
| **WA**  | **0%**                  | N/A       | No specific annual _foreign_ surcharge (standard land tax still applies).     |
| **SA**  | **0%**                  | N/A       | No specific annual _foreign_ surcharge (standard land tax still applies).     |
| **NT**  | **0%**                  | N/A       | No land tax in the Northern Territory.                                        |

- **Note:** Thresholds and definitions vary. In QLD, the surcharge applies to the taxable value _above_ $350,000. Always verify with your solicitor—"Absentee" definitions can differ from "Foreign Person" definitions.

### State-Specific Breakdowns

#### New South Wales (The Heavy Hitter)

NSW has the most aggressive taxation for foreign owners. With a **5% surcharge** (increased from 4% in 2025) plus standard land tax (up to 1.6% or 2%), your total annual tax bill can exceed 6.5% of the land value.

- **The trap:** There's **no tax-free threshold** for the surcharge. Whether you own a studio apartment or a mansion, you pay 5% on the land value.
- **The trust risk:** If you buy via a discretionary trust, and _any_ potential beneficiary is a foreign person (even if they never receive money), Revenue NSW deems the trust "foreign." You must permanently exclude foreign beneficiaries from the trust deed to avoid this.

#### Victoria (The "Absentee" Rule)

Victoria charges a **4% Absentee Owner Surcharge**.

- **The nuance:** Victoria uses the term "Absentee Owner." If you're a foreign citizen but you actually _live_ in Australia (on a specific visa) and use the home as your principal residence, you may be exempt. This is distinct from NSW, where citizenship is often the primary test.

#### Queensland (The Ex Gratia Shift)

Queensland charges a **3% surcharge** (officially the "Land Tax Foreign Surcharge").

- **Update for 2026:** Queensland has tightened its relief provisions. Previously, ex gratia relief was somewhat broader for developers. As of the 2026 tax year, relief is strictly rules-based and primarily targeted at active developers contributing to housing supply, not passive investors.

#### The "Safe Havens": WA, SA, and NT

Western Australia and South Australia currently **do not** impose an annual land tax surcharge on foreign owners. You'll still pay the standard land tax rates applicable to all investors, but you avoid the punitive 2-5% "top-up" seen on the East Coast.

- **Strategy:** For investors purely seeking capital growth without the heavy annual holding costs, Perth (WA) and Adelaide (SA) present a significant structural advantage in 2026.
- **Northern Territory:** The NT remains the only jurisdiction in Australia with **no land tax** at all, for anyone.

### How to Manage the Cost

1. **Calculate before you commit:** Never buy based on rental yield alone. Use our [Property Costs Calculator](/en/calculator) to model the _total_ 10-year cost, including the annual surcharge.
2. **Check your land value:** The surcharge is based on _unimproved land value_, not the purchase price. Apartments typically have a lower land value component than houses, making them more tax-efficient for foreign investors in high-tax states like NSW and VIC.
3. **Review your trust deed:** If you're buying through a family trust, ensure your solicitor includes a "Foreign Person Exclusion Clause" if you intend to be treated as a local buyer (provided you meet the residency requirements).
