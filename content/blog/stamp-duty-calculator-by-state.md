# Australian Stamp Duty Guide 2025: Complete State-by-State Comparison for Property Buyers

*Last updated: 12 January 2025 | 8 min read*

Buying property in Australia means facing one of the largest upfront costs you'll encounter: stamp duty. For foreign buyers, additional surcharges can push these costs even higher. Whether you're purchasing in Sydney, Melbourne, or regional Queensland, understanding how stamp duty varies across states is crucial for smart property investment.

This comprehensive guide breaks down stamp duty rates across all Australian states and territories, explains foreign buyer surcharges, and helps you calculate your true property costs.

## What is Stamp Duty and Why Does It Matter?

Stamp duty (officially called transfer duty in most states) is a state government tax you pay when you buy property. Think of it as the price of admission to property ownership—except this admission fee can easily run into tens of thousands of dollars.

The amount you pay depends on three key factors:

1. **Property value** – Higher-priced properties attract progressively higher rates
2. **Location** – Each state sets its own rates and thresholds
3. **Buyer status** – Foreign buyers pay significant additional surcharges in most states

Unlike ongoing costs like council rates or land tax, stamp duty is a one-time payment due shortly after you sign the purchase contract (typically within 30–90 days depending on the state).

## Understanding the Foreign Buyer Surcharge

If you're not an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you'll face an additional stamp duty surcharge in most states. These surcharges were introduced from 2015 onwards to moderate foreign investment in residential property and ensure foreign buyers contribute to local infrastructure.

**Who qualifies as a foreign buyer?**

You're generally considered a foreign buyer if you're:
- A foreign national (not an Australian citizen)
- A temporary resident (including 457, 482, or student visa holders)
- A foreign company or trust
- A foreign government entity

**Who's exempt?**

You won't pay the foreign buyer surcharge if you're:
- An Australian citizen (even if living overseas)
- An Australian permanent resident
- A New Zealand citizen holding a special category visa (subclass 444) who meets residency requirements

## 2025 Stamp Duty Rates: State-by-State Breakdown

Let's dive into the specific rates for each state and territory. All rates shown are current as of January 2025.

| $5,001 - $75,000 | 1.5% |

## First Home Buyer Concessions Across Australia

Most states offer stamp duty relief for eligible first home buyers. Here's a quick snapshot of current schemes (as of January 2025):

### NSW – First Home Buyer Assistance Scheme (FHBAS)
- **Full exemption:** Properties up to $800,000
- **Partial concession:** $800,001 - $1,000,000
- **First Home Owner Grant:** $10,000 for new homes only

### Victoria – First Home Buyer Duty Exemption
- **Full exemption:** Properties up to $600,000
- **Partial concession:** $600,001 - $750,000
- **First Home Owner Grant:** $10,000 for new homes only
- **Temporary off-the-plan concession:** Available until October 2025

### Queensland – Enhanced First Home Buyer Support

- **First Home Owner Grant:** $15,000 for new homes only
- **Vacant land:** Full exemption up to $350,000; partial concession $350,001-$500,000

### Other States
South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania each offer their own first home buyer concessions with varying thresholds. Check with the relevant state revenue office for current eligibility criteria and property value limits.

**Important:** Concessions typically require you to:
- Be a first-time property owner (you and your partner)
- Be an Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Occupy the property as your primary residence
- Live in the property for a minimum period (usually 12 months)

## How to Calculate Your Total Stamp Duty

Ready to work out your costs? Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Your Base Stamp Duty

Use the rate tables above for your state, or try the [PropertyCosts FIRB Calculator](https://www.propertycosts.com.au/en/firb-calculator) which automatically calculates stamp duty for all states.

### Step 2: Check Your Buyer Status

Are you:
- An Australian citizen or permanent resident? → No surcharge
- A temporary resident or foreign national? → Add the foreign buyer surcharge
- A first home buyer? → Check if you qualify for concessions (may still pay surcharge if foreign)

### Step 3: Add the Foreign Buyer Surcharge

If applicable, calculate your state's surcharge percentage on the full property value:

**Formula:** Property value × Surcharge rate = Surcharge amount

### Step 4: Include Other Costs

Don't forget additional costs:
- **FIRB application fees:** $15,100 - $1,205,200+ (for foreign buyers)
- **Mortgage registration fees:** $100 - $200
- **Transfer/lodgement fees:** $100 - $400
- **Legal/conveyancing fees:** $1,500 - $3,000+

### Example Calculation: Foreign Buyer in NSW

Let's calculate total stamp duty for a foreign buyer purchasing an $800,000 property in Sydney:

1. **Base stamp duty:** $31,090
2. **Foreign buyer surcharge:** $72,000 (9% of $800,000)
3. **FIRB application fee:** $30,300 (for $800,000 property)
4. **Mortgage registration:** $150
5. **Transfer fees:** $200

**Total upfront government costs: $133,740**

That's 16.7% of the purchase price in government fees alone—a substantial amount that must be budgeted for carefully.

## Strategies to Minimize Your Stamp Duty

### For Foreign Buyers

**1. Consider Low-Surcharge States**

NT and ACT have no foreign buyer surcharges. While property markets may be smaller, the savings could be substantial. A $800,000 property saves you up to $72,000 by purchasing in NT versus NSW.

**2. Partner with an Australian Citizen**

If purchasing with an Australian citizen or permanent resident, the surcharge typically only applies to your share of the property. For a 50/50 ownership split, you'd pay the surcharge on only 50% of the value.

**3. Pursue Permanent Residency**

Some states offer partial refunds if you become a permanent resident within a certain timeframe after purchase. Check your state's rules.

**4. Focus on New Developments**

New properties may qualify for first home owner grants (if eligible) or developer exemptions. Some states also offer temporary concessions for off-the-plan purchases.

### For All Buyers

**1. Take Advantage of First Home Buyer Schemes**

If you're eligible, first home buyer concessions can save $10,000 - $50,000+ depending on property value and location.

**2. Time Your Purchase Strategically**

- Consider settling near the end of a financial year to defer some costs
- Watch for temporary concessions or policy changes (like QLD's 2025 stamp duty elimination for first home buyers)

**3. Negotiate on Total Costs**

When making an offer, factor in all closing costs including stamp duty. A property listed at $805,000 might be worth negotiating down to $795,000—saving you money on both purchase price AND stamp duty.

**4. Use Off-the-Plan Concessions**

Several states offer stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan purchases. In Victoria, for example, you can currently deduct post-contract construction costs from the dutiable value (until October 2025).

## Understanding Your Additional Obligations

Stamp duty isn't the only government cost to consider:

### Ongoing Land Tax

Most states charge annual land tax on investment properties (and, in some cases, on second homes) once your total land holdings exceed a certain threshold. Foreign owners often pay:
- Higher land tax rates (surcharge land tax)
- No tax-free threshold in some states
- Absentee owner surcharges (2-4% additional)

### Annual Vacancy Fees (Foreign Owners)

Foreign buyers of established dwellings (where permitted by FIRB) must pay an annual vacancy fee if the property isn't occupied for at least 183 days per year. This fee typically equals double your FIRB application fee.

### FIRB Compliance

Foreign buyers must:
- Obtain FIRB approval before purchasing
- Report annually on property usage
- Comply with development conditions (for vacant land)
- Maintain proper occupancy records

## Important Payment Timelines

Missing stamp duty deadlines can result in penalties and interest charges. Here's when you need to pay:

| State/Territory | Payment Deadline |
|----------------|------------------|
| **NSW** | Within 3 months of contract date |
| **VIC** | Within 30 days of settlement |
| **QLD** | Within 30 days of settlement |
| **SA** | On or before settlement |
| **WA** | Within 2 months after transfer documents lodged |
| **TAS** | Within 3 months of contract date |
| **NT** | Within 60 days of contract |
| **ACT** | Within 28 days of contract/transfer |

Your conveyancer or solicitor typically handles the payment on your behalf, but you remain legally responsible for ensuring timely payment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I add stamp duty to my home loan?**

A: Some lenders allow this, but it's generally not recommended. Adding $50,000 in stamp duty to a 30-year mortgage means you'll pay significant additional interest—potentially $30,000-$50,000 more over the life of the loan. It's better to save separately for stamp duty if possible.

**Q: Do I pay stamp duty if I'm gifted a property?**

A: Yes, stamp duty generally applies to all transfers of property, including gifts. The amount is calculated based on the market value of the property.

**Q: What if the purchase falls through after I've paid stamp duty?**

A: If your contract is cancelled before settlement, you may be eligible for a refund. You must typically apply within 5 years of the original payment. Requirements vary by state.

**Q: I'm an Australian expat living overseas. Do I pay the foreign buyer surcharge?**

A: No. Australian citizens are exempt from foreign buyer surcharges even if living abroad. However, you may be subject to other foreign resident taxes depending on your residency status.

**Q: Does the surcharge apply to commercial property?**

A: Generally no. Foreign buyer surcharges typically only apply to residential property. Commercial property purchases use standard rates.

**Q: Can companies or trusts buy property to avoid the surcharge?**

A: Not really. Foreign ownership rules apply to companies and trusts as well. If a company or trust is controlled by foreign persons (typically 50%+ ownership or interest), the foreign buyer surcharge still applies.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stamp duty varies dramatically by state** – The same $800,000 property costs $17,750 in stamp duty in NT versus $47,190 in ACT (for non-foreign buyers).

2. **Foreign buyer surcharges are substantial** – Ranging from 0% (NT, ACT) to 9% (NSW), these surcharges can add $50,000-$70,000+ to your property costs.

3. **Recent changes have increased costs** – NSW jumped to 9% in January 2025, and QLD rose to 8% in July 2024. Stay current on rate changes.

4. **First home buyer concessions can save thousands** – If eligible, you could save $10,000-$50,000+ depending on your state and property value.

5. **NT and ACT offer foreign buyer savings** – With no foreign buyer surcharges, these territories may suit international investors seeking lower entry costs.

6. **Plan for additional costs beyond stamp duty** – FIRB fees, legal costs, and ongoing land tax can add another $15,000-$50,000+ to your total acquisition costs.

7. **Timing and strategy matter** – Understanding first home buyer schemes, off-the-plan concessions, and strategic settlement timing can significantly reduce your costs.
