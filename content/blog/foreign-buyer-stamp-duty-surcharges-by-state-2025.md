# The Complete State-by-State Guide to Foreign Buyer Stamp Duty Surcharges in Australia (2025 Update)

**Last Updated: November 2025**

If you're a foreign investor eyeing Australian property, stamp duty surcharges are one of your largest upfront costs—and they vary dramatically by state. In New South Wales, you'll pay 9% on top of standard stamp duty. In the Northern Territory? Zero surcharge.

This comprehensive guide breaks down exactly what you'll pay in each state and territory, who qualifies as a "foreign person," and strategic insights to minimize your costs.

## Quick Reference: 2025 Surcharge Rates by State

| State/Territory        | Surcharge Rate   | On Top Of Standard Duty | Effective From  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **New South Wales**    | **9%**           | Yes                     | January 1, 2025 |
| **Victoria**           | **8%**           | Yes                     | Current         |
| **Queensland**         | **8%**           | Yes                     | July 1, 2024    |
| **South Australia**    | **7%**           | Yes                     | Current         |

| **Tasmania**           | **8%**           | Yes                     | Current         |
| **ACT**                | **No surcharge** | N/A                     | N/A             |
| **Northern Territory** | **No surcharge** | N/A                     | N/A             |

**The bottom line:** Where you buy can save you tens of thousands—or cost you hundreds of thousands—in surcharges alone.

## Understanding the Basics: What Is Foreign Buyer Stamp Duty?

### What Is Stamp Duty?

Stamp duty (also called transfer duty or land transfer duty) is a state-based tax levied when property ownership changes hands. It's calculated as a percentage of either the purchase price or market value—whichever is higher.

Standard stamp duty rates typically range from 1.5% to 5.5% depending on the state and property value, with graduated scales where higher-value properties pay higher rates.

### What Is the Foreign Buyer Surcharge?

The foreign buyer stamp duty surcharge is an **additional** tax imposed specifically on foreign purchasers of residential property. It's charged **on top of** the standard stamp duty that all buyers pay.

This surcharge was introduced progressively across Australian states between 2015 and 2019 as a policy measure to:

- Cool the housing market
- Make it more difficult for foreign capital to compete with local buyers
- Generate additional revenue for state governments
- Protect housing affordability for Australian residents

**Important:** The surcharge applies to the full property value, not just the surcharge rate itself.

### Real-World Example

Let's compare a $1 million property purchase in NSW vs. NT:

**New South Wales (9% surcharge):**

- Standard stamp duty: ~$40,000
- Foreign buyer surcharge (9% × $1M): $90,000
- **Total upfront stamp duty: $130,000**

**Northern Territory (no surcharge):**

- Standard stamp duty: ~$40,000
- Foreign buyer surcharge: $0
- **Total upfront stamp duty: $40,000**

**Difference: $90,000 savings in NT**

## State-by-State Breakdown

### 1. New South Wales (NSW): 9% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 9% (increased from 8% on January 1, 2025)
**Applies To:** All residential-related property
**Official Source:** [Revenue NSW](https://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/taxes-duties-levies-royalties/transfer-duty/surcharge-purchaser-duty)

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Person in NSW?

You're a foreign person if you're:

- **Not an Australian citizen**, AND
- **Not a permanent resident**, AND
- **Not a New Zealand citizen** with a special category visa (subclass 444) who has been in Australia for at least 200 days in the 12 months before the contract date

**Temporary residents** (including 457, 482, student visa holders, partner visas) are considered foreign persons for surcharge purposes.

#### Special NSW Rules

**Corporations:** A corporation is foreign if:

- Not incorporated in Australia, OR
- Incorporated in Australia but foreign persons or entities hold a "substantial interest" (20%+) or "aggregate substantial interest" (40%+ combined)

**Trusts:** A trust is foreign if foreign persons hold a substantial interest (20%+) in the trust estate.

#### What Property Does It Apply To?

- Residential land (houses, apartments, townhouses)
- Vacant residential land
- Mixed-use property (surcharge applies to residential portion)

#### Real Calculation Example (NSW)

**Property:** $850,000 apartment in Sydney
**Buyer:** Temporary resident on 482 visa

- Standard stamp duty: ~$33,000
- Foreign buyer surcharge (9% × $850,000): $76,500
- **Total: $109,500**

Plus:

- FIRB application fee: $42,300 (for established dwelling)
- Annual land tax surcharge: 5% (if applicable)

**First-year total cost:** $151,800 before even considering mortgage, insurance, or other costs.

#### Exemptions and Refunds in NSW

**Spousal exemption:** If you buy with an Australian citizen or PR spouse as **joint tenants** (not tenants in common), the surcharge doesn't apply.

**Permanent residency refund:** If you obtain PR within 12 months of purchase or were already in the process, you may be eligible for a refund.

**200-day rule:** If you're a PR and have been in Australia for at least 200 days in the 12 months before contract, you're exempt.

### 2. Victoria (VIC): 8% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 8%
**Applies To:** Residential property
**Official Source:** [State Revenue Office Victoria](https://sro.vic.gov.au/foreign-purchasers-of-property)

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Person in Victoria?

You're a foreign natural person if you're **not**:

- An Australian citizen
- An Australian permanent resident
- A New Zealand citizen with a special category visa (subclass 444)

**Critical difference from NSW:** Victoria doesn't have a 200-day residency requirement for PRs—if you have PR status, you're not considered foreign, even if you live overseas.

#### Victoria-Specific Considerations

**Corporations:** A corporation is foreign if:

- Incorporated outside Australia, OR
- A foreign person has a "controlling interest" (50%+) in the corporation

**Trusts:** Trustees are foreign if foreign persons have a "substantial interest" (50%+ beneficial interest or maximum discretionary entitlement exceeds 50%).

#### What Property Does It Apply To?

- Residential land (including land capable of residential use)
- Land being refurbished/extended for residential use
- Land for residential construction

#### Real Calculation Example (VIC)

**Property:** $650,000 house in Melbourne
**Buyer:** International student

- Standard stamp duty: ~$34,000
- Foreign purchaser additional duty (8% × $650,000): $52,000
- **Total: $86,000**

Plus:

- FIRB fee: $42,300 (established dwelling)
- Annual absentee land tax surcharge: 4% (if applicable)

#### Key Victorian Exemption: Principal Place of Residence

If you purchase jointly with an Australian citizen/PR spouse as **joint tenants** AND:

- You live in the property as your principal place of residence
- For a continuous 12-month period
- Starting within 12 months of becoming entitled to possession

...you may be entitled to an exemption from the additional duty.

**Important:** You must apply for this exemption. The Commissioner has discretion to vary the 12-month residence period in special circumstances.

#### Build-to-Rent Exemptions

Victoria offers exemptions for qualifying Build-to-Rent developments. Foreign corporations/trusts may be exempt if their activities add to Victoria's housing stock.

### 3. Queensland (QLD): 8% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 8% (increased from 7% on July 1, 2024)
**Official Name:** Additional Foreign Acquirer Duty (AFAD)
**Official Source:** [Queensland Revenue Office](https://qro.qld.gov.au/duties/investors/afad/)

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Acquirer in Queensland?

**Individuals:** You're a foreign acquirer if you're not:

- An Australian citizen
- An Australian permanent resident
- A New Zealand citizen with a special category visa (subclass 444)

**Note:** Queensland's definition aligns with FIRB's definition of "foreign person."

#### Queensland-Specific Rules

**Corporations:** Foreign if:

- Incorporated outside Australia, OR
- Foreign persons have a "substantial interest" (20%+) or "aggregate substantial interest" (40%+ combined)

**Trusts:** Foreign if foreign persons/entities have a substantial interest (20%+ minimum possible distribution or 100% discretionary power).

**Partial Interests:** AFAD only applies to the portion being acquired by the foreign person.

#### Real Calculation Example (QLD)

**Property:** $600,000 townhouse in Brisbane
**Buyer:** Foreign national purchasing 50% with Australian citizen spouse

- Standard stamp duty (full property): ~$16,500
- AFAD (8% × $600,000 × 50%): $24,000
- **Total: $40,500**

The surcharge only applies to the foreign buyer's 50% share if purchasing as tenants in common.

#### Major 2025 Changes in Queensland

**Massive Stamp Duty Reform:** Queensland eliminated stamp duty for first home buyers purchasing new builds (no value cap) effective June 9, 2024.

**This doesn't eliminate AFAD:** Foreign buyers still pay the 8% surcharge even on new builds, but they benefit from $0 standard stamp duty on new properties.

**Example benefit:**

- $700,000 new apartment
- Standard stamp duty (Australian): $0
- AFAD (foreign buyer): $56,000
- **Savings vs. established property:** ~$17,000

---

### 4. South Australia (SA): 7% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 7%
**Applies To:** Residential property
**Effective:** January 1, 2018

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Person in SA?

The definition largely follows FIRB's definition:

- Not an Australian citizen
- Not an Australian permanent resident
- Not a NZ citizen with special category visa

#### What Property Does It Apply To?

- Residential land
- Land for residential development
- Mixed-use property (apportioned to residential component)

#### Real Calculation Example (SA)

**Property:** $500,000 house in Adelaide
**Buyer:** Temporary resident

- Standard stamp duty: ~$21,500
- Foreign ownership surcharge (7% × $500,000): $35,000
- **Total: $56,500**

#### SA Advantage for Returning Residents

South Australia is noted for providing "the most generous exemptions for returning residents" according to industry analysis. If you're an Australian citizen or PR who has been living overseas, SA's interpretation tends to be more favorable.

---

### 5. Western Australia (WA): 7% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 7%
**Applies To:** Residential property
**Official Source:** WA Department of Finance

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Person in WA?

**Individuals:**

- Not an Australian citizen
- Not holding a permanent residence visa
- Not a NZ citizen with subclass 444 visa

**Corporations:** Foreign if:

- Not incorporated in Australia, OR
- Foreign persons have a substantial interest (40%+)

#### What Property Does It Apply To?

- Residential property
- **Excludes:** Commercial property, residential developments (10+ properties), mixed-use properties primarily for commercial purposes

#### Real Calculation Example (WA)

**Property:** $750,000 house in Perth
**Buyer:** Foreign corporation (100% foreign ownership)

- Standard stamp duty: ~$30,000
- Foreign purchaser surcharge (7% × $750,000): $52,500
- **Total: $82,500**

#### WA-Specific Consideration

Contact the WA Department of Finance at +61 8 9262 1100 for specific advice, as interpretations and exemptions can vary.

### 6. Tasmania (TAS): 8% Surcharge

**Current Rate:** 8% (residential property)
**Additional:** 1.5% (primary production land)
**Applies To:** Residential and primary production land

#### Who Is Considered a Foreign Person in Tasmania?

**Individuals:**

- Not an Australian citizen
- Not an Australian permanent resident
- Not a NZ citizen with subclass 444 visa

Tasmania is noted for having "strict documentation requirements" despite the lack of major concessions.

#### What Property Does It Apply To?

- **Residential property:** 8% surcharge
- **Primary production land:** 1.5% surcharge

This makes Tasmania unique—it's one of the few jurisdictions charging surcharges on agricultural land.

#### Real Calculation Example (TAS)

**Property:** $400,000 apartment in Hobart
**Buyer:** Temporary resident

- Standard stamp duty: ~$13,000
- Foreign investor duty surcharge (8% × $400,000): $32,000
- **Total: $45,000**

Tasmania's surcharge rate matches Victoria despite having lower property prices, making the relative burden significant.

---

### 7. Australian Capital Territory (ACT): NO SURCHARGE

**Current Rate:** **0%** (no stamp duty surcharge for foreign buyers)
**Alternative Consideration:** 0.75% foreign land tax surcharge applies

#### Why No Stamp Duty Surcharge?

The ACT is one of only two jurisdictions not imposing a stamp duty surcharge on foreign buyers. This creates a significant competitive advantage for foreign investment in Canberra.

#### What You'll Pay Instead

While there's no stamp duty surcharge, foreign owners in ACT face:

- **Standard stamp duty:** Same as Australian residents (rates vary by property value)
- **Foreign surcharge land tax:** 0.75% of unimproved land value (annual)

#### Real Calculation Example (ACT)

**Property:** $650,000 apartment in Canberra
**Buyer:** Foreign investor

- Standard stamp duty: ~$22,000
- Foreign buyer surcharge: **$0**
- **Total upfront: $22,000**

**Annual ongoing:**

- Land tax surcharge: 0.75% of unimproved value

#### Strategic Advantage

The ACT's lack of stamp duty surcharge, combined with a land tax surcharge of only 0.75%, makes it attractive for cross-border investors compared to states with 7-9% stamp duty surcharges.

---

### 8. Northern Territory (NT): NO SURCHARGE

**Current Rate:** **0%** (no stamp duty surcharge)
**Land Tax:** None (NT doesn't impose land tax at all)

#### The NT Advantage

Northern Territory is the only state free of both a stamp duty surcharge and land tax hike. This makes it the most tax-advantaged jurisdiction for foreign property investment in Australia.

#### What You'll Pay

- **Standard stamp duty:** Same rates as Australian residents
- **Foreign buyer surcharge:** $0
- **Annual land tax:** $0 (NT has no land tax)

#### Real Calculation Example (NT)

**Property:** $500,000 house in Darwin
**Buyer:** Foreign investor

- Standard stamp duty: ~$20,000
- Foreign buyer surcharge: **$0**
- **Total: $20,000**

**Annual ongoing costs:**

- Land tax: **$0**

**Comparison:** The same property in NSW would cost:

- Stamp duty + surcharge: $65,000
- **Savings in NT: $45,000**

#### Why Isn't NT More Popular?

While the tax advantages are clear, foreign investment levels remain moderate due to:

- Smaller, less liquid property market
- Fewer premium property options
- Distance from major economic centers
- Climate considerations

However, for investors prioritizing tax efficiency and rental yields (Darwin offers some of Australia's highest), NT presents a compelling case.

## Who Exactly Is a "Foreign Person"? Detailed Definitions

The devil is in the details. Here's what determines your status:

### Individuals

✅ **NOT foreign (no surcharge):**

- Australian citizens
- Australian permanent residents
- New Zealand citizens with special category visa (subclass 444)

❌ **Foreign (surcharge applies):**

- Foreign nationals (any country)
- Temporary visa holders (457, 482, student, partner visas, etc.)
- Bridging visa holders (in most cases)

### The 200-Day Rule (NSW Only)

In NSW, even permanent residents can be considered foreign if they haven't been in Australia for at least 200 days in the 12 months before the contract date.

### Corporations

A corporation is generally foreign if:

- Incorporated outside Australia, OR
- Foreign persons/entities hold:
  - **Substantial interest:** 20%+ ownership (most states)
  - **Controlling interest:** 50%+ ownership (Victoria)
  - **Aggregate substantial interest:** 40%+ combined ownership by multiple foreign parties

### Trusts

A trust is generally foreign if:

- The trustee is foreign, OR
- Foreign persons have:
  - A substantial beneficial interest (typically 20%+), OR
  - Maximum discretionary entitlement exceeds the threshold, OR
  - The trustee has 100% discretionary power to distribute to foreign persons

### Special Cases

**Joint Tenants vs. Tenants in Common:**

- **Joint tenants** with Australian citizen/PR spouse: May be exempt (check state-specific rules)
- **Tenants in common:** Surcharge applies proportionally to foreign person's share

**Corporate Structures:**

- Multiple layers of ownership are "looked through" to determine ultimate foreign control
- Complex structures should seek professional advice

## Strategic Insights: How to Minimize Your Surcharge

### Strategy 1: Choose Your State Wisely

If you have flexibility in where you invest:

**Lowest cost jurisdictions:**

1. **Northern Territory:** 0% surcharge, 0% land tax
2. **ACT:** 0% surcharge, 0.75% land tax surcharge
3. **SA/WA:** 7% surcharge (lowest among states with surcharges)

**Highest cost jurisdictions:**

1. **NSW:** 9% surcharge + 5% annual land tax surcharge
2. **VIC/QLD/TAS:** 8% surcharge + varying land tax surcharges

**Savings example:** Buying a $1M property in NT vs. NSW saves $90,000 upfront.

### Strategy 2: Purchase with an Australian Spouse as Joint Tenants

If you're married to or in a de facto relationship with an Australian citizen/PR:

- Purchase as **joint tenants** (not tenants in common)
- Some states provide full exemption
- Check state-specific rules carefully

**Important:** This doesn't work in all states and doesn't apply to other relationships (siblings, business partners, parents/children).

### Strategy 3: Pursue Permanent Residency First

If you're planning to apply for PR:

- Consider waiting until approval before purchasing
- OR structure purchase to qualify for refund if PR granted within 12 months
- Calculate the cost of waiting vs. paying surcharge

### Strategy 4: Focus on New Construction

In Queensland, foreign buyers benefit from:

- $0 stamp duty on new builds (any price)
- Only 8% AFAD surcharge applies
- Still saves money vs. established property

In other states:

- Some offer concessions for new construction
- Build-to-Rent projects may qualify for exemptions (VIC, QLD)
- Consider buying land + building vs. established dwelling

### Strategy 5: Structure Through Exempt Entities

Some development corporations may qualify for exemptions if:

- Incorporated in Australia
- Genuinely increase housing stock
- Meet state-specific eligibility criteria

**Caution:** This is complex and requires professional legal/tax advice.

### Strategy 6: Time Your Purchase Strategically

- **Before becoming a temporary resident:** May avoid surcharge in some circumstances
- **After obtaining PR:** Eliminates surcharge entirely
- **Around the 200-day mark (NSW):** Ensure you meet residency requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I'm an Australian citizen living overseas. Do I pay the surcharge?**

A: No. Australian citizens are exempt from foreign buyer surcharges in all states, even if you're living abroad permanently. However, you may still face stamp duty itself and potentially absentee owner land tax surcharges in some states.

**Q: I'm on a 482 work visa. Am I considered foreign?**

A: Yes. Temporary visa holders are considered foreign persons and subject to the surcharge. The only visa exemptions are for:

- Australian PR holders
- NZ citizens with subclass 444 visa (meeting 200-day requirement in NSW)

**Q: Can I get a refund if I get PR after buying?**

A: Depends on the state:

- **NSW:** Yes, if obtained within 12 months or meeting 200-day rule
- **Victoria:** No automatic refund, but may apply for exemption under specific PPR conditions
- **Other states:** Varies; seek specific advice

**Q: Does the surcharge apply to commercial property?**

A: Generally no. Surcharges typically apply only to residential property. However, for mixed-use property, surcharges are apportioned to the residential component.

**Q: I'm buying 50/50 with my Australian spouse. Do I pay the surcharge?**

A: It depends on how you structure ownership:

- **Joint tenants** with spousal relationship: May be exempt (check state rules)
- **Tenants in common:** Surcharge applies to your 50% share only

**Q: Is the surcharge tax-deductible?**

A: No. Stamp duty and surcharges are capital costs, not deductible expenses. They form part of your cost base for capital gains tax purposes when you eventually sell.

**Q: Can I nominate someone else to buy on my behalf to avoid the surcharge?**

A: No. This is illegal and constitutes stamp duty evasion. Revenue authorities look through nominee arrangements to determine the true beneficial owner. Penalties for evasion can be severe.

**Q: Does buying off-the-plan reduce the surcharge?**

A: No—the surcharge rate is the same whether you buy established or off-the-plan. However, in Queensland, you benefit from $0 standard stamp duty on new builds, so your total cost is lower (surcharge only).

**Q: What if I'm from New Zealand, Finland, Germany, or South Africa?**

A: There was some historic consideration around double tax treaties, but the Foreign Investment Bill 2024 allows states to impose foreign surcharges despite these treaties. Check current state-specific rules, as interpretations vary.

## Recent Changes and What's Coming in 2025-2026

### Implemented Changes

**NSW (January 1, 2025):**

- Stamp duty surcharge: 8% → **9%**
- Land tax surcharge: 4% → **5%**
- Capital gains withholding: 12.5% → **15%**

**Queensland (July 1, 2024):**

**FIRB (April 9, 2024):**

### What's Coming

**Established Dwelling Ban (April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027):**
Federal government implementing temporary ban on foreign purchases of established dwellings with limited exceptions for:

- Temporary residents (principal residence only)
- Build-to-Rent projects
- Major redevelopment (20+ dwellings)

This will effectively eliminate established dwelling purchases for most foreign non-residents, making surcharges less relevant for this category.

**Potential Future Increases:**
With NSW leading at 9%, other states may follow suit. Queensland and Victoria traditionally align their policies, so watch for potential increases in 2026-2027.

5. **Structure matters** — joint tenants vs. tenants in common affects liability
6. **Timing matters** — obtaining PR before or shortly after purchase can save tens of thousands
