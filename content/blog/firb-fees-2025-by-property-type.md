## What is FIRB and Why Do You Need Approval?

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is Australia's regulatory body that oversees foreign investment in Australian assets, including residential property. If you're a foreign person—including temporary residents, international students, or non-residents—you must obtain FIRB approval before purchasing property in Australia.

Failing to obtain approval can result in serious consequences, including:

- Civil penalties up to $3.33 million for individuals
- Criminal penalties including imprisonment
- Forced divestment of the property
- Inability to register the property title

| Over $40 million       | $3,615,600                                 |

**Note:** These fees are triple the rates for new dwellings, reflecting the government's policy to discourage foreign investment in existing housing stock.

### Limited Exceptions to the Established Dwelling Ban

The only circumstances where foreign persons may still purchase established dwellings are:

1. **Significant Housing Supply Projects:** Redevelopment that creates at least 20 additional dwellings (increased from 1 dwelling in April 2024)

2. **Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme:** Employee accommodation for workers from Pacific island countries and Timor-Leste

3. **Spouses of Citizens/Permanent Residents:** When purchased as joint tenants with an Australian citizen, permanent resident, or New Zealand citizen

4. **Existing Approvals:** Foreign investors who received FIRB approval before 1 April 2025 can generally proceed with their purchase

### 3. Property Developer Exemption Certificates

Developers selling new dwellings to foreign buyers can obtain a streamlined bulk approval:

- **Initial Application Fee (2025-2026):** $65,200
- **Separate per-sale fee:** Charged for each individual dwelling sold to a foreign person
- **Valid for:** 12 months, with sales reported every 6 months

This certificate allows developers to sell multiple new dwellings to foreign buyers without requiring each buyer to apply for individual FIRB approval.

### 4. Variation Fees

If you need to modify an existing FIRB approval:

- **Simple Variation (2025-2026):** $4,500
- **Complex Variation (2025-2026):** $30,300

Variation fees are capped at the original application fee you paid.

### 5. Tenants in Common

When purchasing as tenants in common (not joint ownership), you only pay for your percentage share:

**Example:** If you're purchasing 25% of a $2 million new dwelling:

- Full fee: $30,300
- Your fee: $7,575 (25% of $30,300)

## Additional Costs: Vacancy Fees

Foreign investors who purchased residential property after 9 May 2017 must also be aware of vacancy fees. Understanding these obligations is crucial for managing your investment costs. Read our detailed guide on [How to Avoid FIRB Vacancy Fees](/vacancy-fee-guide).

### What is the Vacancy Fee?

If your property is vacant or not genuinely available for rent for 183 days (6 months) or more in a vacancy year, you must pay a vacancy fee.

**Vacancy Fee Amount (from 9 April 2024):**

- **Double** your original FIRB application fee

**Example:**

- Property value: Under $2 million (new dwelling)
- Original FIRB fee paid in 2024: $28,200
- If vacant for 6+ months: Vacancy fee = $56,400

### When Must You Lodge a Vacancy Fee Return?

You must lodge a vacancy fee return annually by 1 December, even if no fee is payable. The vacancy year runs from the settlement date anniversary.

## FIRB Fee Calculation Examples: Real-World Scenarios

### Example 1: New Apartment in Sydney

**Scenario:** Chinese investor purchasing a new off-the-plan apartment in Sydney for $950,000

- Property type: New dwelling
- Property value: $950,000
- **FIRB application fee: $15,100**
- Additional costs: Stamp duty + foreign buyer surcharge (8% in NSW)
- Total stamp duty: Approximately $78,100

**Total FIRB-related costs:** $15,100

### Example 2: Vacant Land Development in Brisbane

**Scenario:** Indian investor purchasing vacant land in Brisbane for $550,000 to build townhouses

- Property type: Vacant residential land
- Property value: $550,000
- **FIRB application fee: $15,100**
- Development condition: Must complete construction within 4 years
- Additional costs: Stamp duty + foreign buyer surcharge (7% in Queensland)

**Total FIRB-related costs:** $15,100

### Example 3: Redevelopment Project (Exception Case)

**Scenario:** Hong Kong developer purchasing established dwelling for $2.5 million to redevelop into 25 apartments

- Property type: Established dwelling (with redevelopment exception)
- Property value: $2.5 million
- **FIRB application fee: $181,800**
- Qualification: Creating 20+ additional dwellings
- Additional costs: State stamp duty surcharges apply

**Total FIRB-related costs:** $181,800

### Example 4: Student Visa Holder (Pre-April 2025)

**Important:** As of 1 April 2025, temporary residents (including students) can no longer purchase established dwellings, even as their principal residence. This example shows the previous rules for context.

**Previous scenario (no longer applicable):** International student purchasing $600,000 apartment to live in

- This type of purchase is **no longer permitted** from 1 April 2025
- Students must now purchase new dwellings or off-the-plan properties only

## Build-to-Rent Developments: Concessional Treatment

Foreign investors in build-to-rent (BTR) projects receive preferential fee treatment:

- **Fees calculated at commercial land rates** instead of higher residential rates
- Significantly reduces application costs for large-scale rental housing projects
- Applies to projects that commence construction after 14 December 2023

This policy aims to encourage foreign investment in rental housing supply while discouraging speculation in existing homes.

## State Surcharges: Additional Costs Beyond FIRB Fees

## Looking Ahead: The 2027 Review

- Modify the ban conditions
- Return to previous rules

This review will assess the policy's impact on:

- Housing affordability for Australians
- Housing supply and construction activity
- Foreign investment flows
- Property market dynamics

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need FIRB approval if I'm a permanent resident?

No. Australian permanent residents are not considered foreign persons and don't require FIRB approval.

### Can I get a mortgage as a foreign buyer?

Yes, but requirements are stricter. Expect:

- Higher deposit requirements (30-40%)
- FIRB approval required before loan approval
- Interest rates may be 0.5-1% higher
- More extensive documentation

### What counts as a "new dwelling"?

A dwelling that has never been previously sold or occupied as a residence, including:

- Newly constructed houses
- New apartments in completed buildings
- Off-the-plan apartments (pre-construction purchases)

### Can temporary residents still buy property in 2025?

Yes, but **only new dwellings or vacant land**. From 1 April 2025, temporary residents (including student visa holders) can no longer purchase established dwellings, even as their primary residence.

For detailed guidance on buying property on different visa types, see our [Property Buying Guide by Visa Status](/visa-property-guide).

### How long is FIRB approval valid?

Generally 12 months from the date of approval. You must complete the purchase within this timeframe or reapply.

### What happens if property values change after I apply?

FIRB fees are based on the purchase price stated in your application. If the price changes significantly, you may need to submit a variation application with additional fees.

## Conclusion

FIRB fees in 2025 reflect the Australian government's clear policy direction: encouraging foreign investment in new housing that increases supply while protecting existing housing stock for local buyers. With fees for established dwellings tripled and a temporary ban in place, foreign investors must focus on new developments, vacant land, or build-to-rent projects.

The key to success as a foreign property investor in Australia is:

1. Understanding the complete cost structure upfront
2. Focusing on permitted property types (new dwellings, vacant land)
3. Complying with all FIRB conditions and reporting requirements
4. Planning for both acquisition costs and ongoing obligations
