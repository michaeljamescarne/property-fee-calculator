# Complete Guide: Australian Visa Types and FIRB Property Requirements 2025

*Last updated: 8 January 2025 | 10 min read*

Your visa status is the single most important factor determining whether you need FIRB approval to buy Australian property—and what type of property you can purchase. Get this wrong, and you could face penalties ranging from forced property sales to criminal charges.

This comprehensive guide breaks down exactly what FIRB requirements apply to your specific visa category, including the critical changes affecting temporary residents from April 2025.

## Understanding "Foreign Person" Status

Before diving into visa-specific requirements, you need to understand how FIRB classifies buyers.

### FIRB's Definition of "Foreign Person"

Under Australian foreign investment law, you're generally considered a "foreign person" if you are:

**An individual who is:**
- NOT an Australian citizen
- NOT an Australian permanent resident
- NOT a New Zealand citizen (with subclass 444 visa)
- NOT "ordinarily resident" in Australia

**OR a corporation/trust where:**
- Foreign person(s) hold 20% or more interest (substantial interest)
- Two or more foreign persons together hold 40% or more interest (aggregate substantial interest)

### The Critical Concept: "Ordinarily Resident"

To be "ordinarily resident" in Australia, you must meet TWO requirements:

1. **Legal right to stay indefinitely:** Your continued presence in Australia is not subject to any time limitation imposed by law (i.e., you're a permanent resident or hold certain partner visas)

2. **Physical presence:** You've been in Australia for at least **200 days** within the 12 months **before** the contract date

**Important:** Even if you've lived in Australia for years, if you're on a temporary visa (student visa, 482, etc.), you're NOT considered "ordinarily resident" for FIRB purposes.

## FIRB Requirements by Visa Category

### Category 1: No FIRB Approval Required

These visa holders are treated the same as Australian citizens for property purchase purposes.

#### Australian Citizens

**FIRB Status:** Exempt from all FIRB requirements

**What you can buy:**
- ✅ Established dwellings (existing homes)
- ✅ New dwellings
- ✅ Vacant land
- ✅ For owner-occupation OR investment
- ✅ No restrictions on number of properties

**Additional considerations:**
- Still subject to state-based stamp duty (but no foreign buyer surcharge)
- No foreign buyer land tax surcharges
- **Important:** Living overseas doesn't change this—Australian citizens living abroad remain exempt from FIRB

#### Australian Permanent Residents

**FIRB Status:** Exempt from all FIRB requirements

**What you can buy:**
- ✅ Established dwellings (existing homes)
- ✅ New dwellings
- ✅ Vacant land
- ✅ For owner-occupation OR investment
- ✅ No restrictions on number of properties

**Conditions for exemption:**
- Must meet the "ordinarily resident" test (200 days in Australia in past 12 months)
- If you fail the 200-day test, you may be treated as a foreign buyer for stamp duty purposes in some states

**Key advantage:** Unlike temporary residents, permanent residents keep these rights even if they spend extended time overseas (as long as their permanent residency remains valid).

#### New Zealand Citizens (Subclass 444 Special Category Visa)

**FIRB Status:** Exempt from all FIRB requirements

**What you can buy:**
- ✅ Established dwellings (existing homes)
- ✅ New dwellings
- ✅ Vacant land
- ✅ For owner-occupation OR investment
- ✅ No restrictions on number of properties

**Special provisions:**
- Automatically granted subclass 444 visa upon entry to Australia
- Treated identically to Australian citizens for FIRB purposes
- Generally exempt from foreign buyer stamp duty surcharges (if meeting residency requirements)

**Important note:** Some states require the 200-day physical presence test for stamp duty exemption, so check your specific state's requirements.

### Category 2: Temporary Residents (Significantly Affected by 2025 Ban)

This is the largest category affected by the April 2025 changes.

#### Who is a "Temporary Resident"?

You're classified as a temporary resident if you:

**Option 1: Hold an eligible temporary visa:**
- Your temporary visa permits you to remain in Australia for a continuous period of **more than 12 months**
- AND you must actually be residing in Australia

**Option 2: On a bridging visa:**
- You're residing in Australia
- You've submitted an application for a permanent visa
- You hold a bridging visa that permits you to stay in Australia until the permanent visa application is finalized

#### Common Temporary Visa Categories

**Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) Visa (Subclass 482)**
- 2-4 year visa for skilled workers
- Qualifies as temporary resident
- Subject to FIRB requirements

**Employer Sponsored Visas:**
- Subclass 494 (Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional Provisional)
- Subclass 491 (Skilled Work Regional Provisional)
- Both qualify as temporary residents

**Student Visas (Subclass 500)**
- Duration typically exceeds 12 months
- Qualifies as temporary resident

- Subclass 188 (Business Innovation and Investment Provisional)
- Qualifies as temporary resident

**Bridging Visas:**
- If awaiting permanent visa decision
- Must be residing in Australia

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE: Established Dwelling Ban (April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027)

**WHAT CHANGED:**

Before April 1, 2025, temporary residents could purchase **one established dwelling** to use as their primary residence.

**From April 1, 2025:**
- Temporary residents **CANNOT** purchase established dwellings
- The ban applies even if you want to live in the property as your primary residence
- Very limited exceptions apply (redevelopment creating 20+ dwellings, certain build-to-rent projects)

**What temporary residents CAN still buy:**

**✅ New Dwellings:**
- Off-the-plan apartments
- House-and-land packages
- Newly constructed properties not previously occupied
- No limit on number (each requires FIRB approval)
- Can be for investment or owner-occupation
- FIRB approval required for each purchase

**✅ Vacant Land:**
- For residential development
- Must commence construction within 24 months
- Must complete all construction within 4 years
- Cannot sell until construction complete
- FIRB approval required
- Development conditions will be imposed

**❌ Established Dwellings (BANNED until March 31, 2027):**
- Cannot buy existing houses
- Cannot buy existing apartments
- Cannot buy any previously occupied residential property
- Even if you want to live in it as your primary residence
- Limited exceptions for large redevelopments only

#### Historical Rules (Pre-April 2025 and likely Post-March 2027)

For context and future planning, here were the previous rules:

**Established Dwellings (Historical):**
- Could purchase ONE established dwelling only
- Must be used as primary residence
- Cannot rent out while you own it
- Must sell within 3 months of:
  - Moving out of the dwelling, OR
  - Your temporary visa expiring, OR  
  - Leaving Australia permanently
- **Whichever comes first**

**Example (Historical):**
James held a student visa and bought an established apartment in 2023 to live in during his studies. He completed his degree in December 2024 and received a job offer in Sydney (his apartment was in Melbourne). Under the old rules, he had to sell within 3 months of moving to Sydney, even though his visa remained valid.

#### FIRB Application Requirements for Temporary Residents

**For each property purchase, you must:**

1. **Apply for FIRB approval BEFORE signing the contract**
2. **Pay the application fee** based on property value:
   - Up to $1M: $15,100
   - $1-2M: $30,300
   - $2-3M: $60,600
   - Higher values: See full fee schedule

3. **Wait for approval** (typically 30 days)

4. **Include FIRB condition in contract:** Your contract should be "subject to FIRB approval"

**Exemption Certificates for Temporary Residents:**

If buying a new dwelling from a developer with an existing exemption certificate:
- You don't need individual FIRB approval
- Developer's certificate covers your purchase
- Still need to notify ATO within 30 days of purchase
- Streamlines process significantly

### Category 3: Foreign Nationals (No Australian Visa or Tourist Visa)

If you're not an Australian citizen, permanent resident, NZ citizen, or temporary resident, you're classified as a "non-resident foreign person."

#### Who Falls in This Category?

- Foreign nationals with no Australian visa
- Tourist visa holders (typically under 12 months)
- Business visa holders (short term, under 12 months)
- Anyone with a temporary visa under 12 months duration
- Foreign nationals living overseas

#### FIRB Requirements for Non-Resident Foreign Persons

**What you CAN buy:**

**✅ New Dwellings:**
- FIRB approval required for each purchase
- No restrictions on number
- Can be for investment (common for overseas investors)
- Property must be newly constructed/never occupied
- Must pay FIRB application fees

**✅ Vacant Land:**
- FIRB approval required
- Must be for residential development
- Strict development conditions:
  - Construction must commence within 24 months
  - All construction completed within 4 years
  - Cannot resell until construction complete
- Higher scrutiny from FIRB
- Must demonstrate capability to complete development

**❌ Established Dwellings:**
- Generally NOT permitted
- Temporary ban from April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2027 reinforces this
- Very limited exceptions:
  - Redevelopment creating 20+ new dwellings
  - Certain qualifying build-to-rent projects
  - Specific diplomatic or consular purposes

#### Special Considerations for Overseas Buyers

**Challenges:**
- More difficult to obtain Australian mortgages
- Typically need 40-60% deposit
- Higher interest rates (if financing available)
- Limited lender options
- Currency exchange risks

**Common approach:**
- Many non-resident foreign persons buy with cash
- Or use financing from their home country
- Property managers essential for overseas investors
- Consider tax implications in both countries

### Category 4: Special Visa Situations

#### Spousal Exemption (Joint Tenants)

**If you're purchasing with an Australian citizen or permanent resident spouse:**

**Requirements for exemption:**
- Must be in a genuine spousal or de facto relationship
- Must purchase as **joint tenants** (equal 50/50 ownership)
- Both parties must intend to occupy as primary residence

**What this means:**
- No FIRB approval required (if all conditions met)
- Foreign partner doesn't need separate application
- Both treated as non-foreign for this purchase

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Tenants in common (unequal ownership)
- Business partners
- Parent and child
- Siblings
- Other family members
- Friends or relatives (unless also spouses)

**Important:** Some states may still charge foreign buyer stamp duty surcharge on the foreign partner's share. Check your specific state requirements.

**Example:**
Sarah (Australian citizen) and Tom (UK citizen on 482 visa) are married. They buy a house together as joint tenants for $900,000 to live in as their family home.

- ✅ No FIRB approval needed
- ❌ May still pay foreign surcharge on 50% of value in some states
- ✅ Both can live in and own the property

#### Bridging Visa Holders Awaiting Permanent Residency

**Situation:**
You're on a bridging visa while your permanent visa application is being processed.

**FIRB Status:**
- Treated as temporary resident
- Subject to temporary resident rules
- Cannot buy established dwellings (during ban period)
- Can buy new dwellings and vacant land with FIRB approval

**What happens when permanent visa is granted?**
- Immediately become exempt from FIRB requirements
- No longer subject to any FIRB conditions on future purchases
- Existing properties: Any FIRB conditions attached to previous purchases (e.g., must sell established dwelling when leaving) no longer apply once you become permanent resident

**Strategic timing:**
- Some buyers wait for permanent visa grant before purchasing
- Avoids FIRB fees and conditions
- But may miss property opportunities

#### Visa Status Changes During Property Ownership

**Scenario 1: Temporary Resident Becomes Permanent Resident**

If you bought as a temporary resident and later become a permanent resident:
- Previous FIRB conditions no longer apply
- Don't need to sell if moving out (under old rules)
- Can convert to investment property if desired
- Can purchase established dwellings without FIRB approval

**Scenario 2: Temporary Visa Expires**

Under historical rules (pre-ban), if your visa expired:
- Must sell established dwelling within 3 months
- May be able to apply for extension in exceptional circumstances
- New dwellings: Can retain as long as meet other visa requirements
- Failure to sell can result in forced disposal and penalties

**Scenario 3: Leave Australia Permanently**

As a temporary resident (historical rules):
- Must sell established dwelling within 3 months of departure
- Can retain new dwelling/vacant land properties
- Consider appointing property manager
- Tax implications for non-residents

## The FIRB Application Process

### Step 1: Determine Your FIRB Status

Use the [PropertyCosts FIRB Calculator](https://www.propertycosts.com.au/en/firb-calculator) to:
- Confirm if you need FIRB approval
- Calculate expected fees
- Understand conditions that will apply

### Step 2: Find Your Property

**Before making an offer:**
- Confirm property type (new/established/vacant land)
- Ensure it's eligible for your visa category
- Check developer has exemption certificate (if applicable)

**Making the offer:**
- Always include "subject to FIRB approval" condition
- This protects you if FIRB denies approval
- Negotiate settlement timeline allowing for FIRB process (30+ days)

### Step 3: Apply for FIRB Approval

**Application method:**
- Online through ATO's Foreign Investment Portal
- Must be completed before signing contract (ideally)
- Or immediately after signing (if contract conditional)

**Required information:**
- Personal identification (passport)
- Visa details and documentation
- Property details (address, purchase price, type)
- Intended use (residence or investment)
- Evidence of deposit capability

**Application fees:**
Based on property value:
- Less than $75,000: $4,500
- Up to $1M: $15,100
- Up to $2M: $30,300
- Up to $5M: $121,200
- Up to $10M: $272,700
- Over $40M: $1,205,200

### Step 4: Wait for Decision

**Processing time:**
- Typically 30 days
- Can be longer if more information needed
- Clock starts when application is complete and fee paid

**Possible outcomes:**
- **Approved:** Will include conditions you must follow
- **More information required:** Must respond promptly
- **Denied:** Rare for straightforward residential purchases if rules followed

### Step 5: Proceed with Purchase

**Once approved:**
- Share FIRB approval letter with conveyancer
- Proceed with settlement as normal
- Ensure you understand and can meet all conditions

**Common conditions:**
- Must occupy as primary residence (established dwellings, historical)
- Must commence/complete construction within timeframes (vacant land)
- Must notify ATO of any changes
- Annual vacancy fee returns (if applicable)

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Assuming Temporary Visa = Permanent Resident Rights

**The problem:**
Many temporary visa holders assume they have the same property rights as permanent residents.

**Reality:**
- Temporary residents face significant restrictions
- Currently cannot buy established dwellings
- Must obtain FIRB approval for new dwellings and vacant land
- Conditions apply to property ownership

**Solution:**
Check your exact visa category and current FIRB rules before house hunting.

### Mistake 2: Buying Without FIRB Approval

**The problem:**
Some buyers sign contracts without FIRB approval, assuming they'll get it later.

**Consequences:**
- Criminal and civil penalties
- Fines up to $1.65M (individuals) or $16.5M (corporations)
- Forced sale of property
- Difficulty getting mortgages
- Permanent record

**Solution:**
ALWAYS apply for FIRB approval before or immediately after signing (with appropriate contract conditions).

### Mistake 3: Misunderstanding "Joint Tenants" Exemption

**The problem:**
Foreign nationals assume buying with ANY Australian citizen avoids FIRB.

**Reality:**
- Exemption only applies to genuine spouses/de facto partners
- Must purchase as joint tenants (equal ownership)
- Doesn't apply to other relationships

**Example of what DOESN'T work:**
- Adult child (foreign national) buying with parent (Australian citizen)
- Friends pooling funds
- Business partners
- Siblings

**Solution:**
Only rely on spousal exemption if genuinely married/de facto AND buying as joint tenants.

### Mistake 4: Not Planning for Visa Expiry

**The problem:**
Temporary residents buy property without considering what happens when visa expires.

**Consequences (historical rules):**
- Must sell established dwelling within 3 months
- May be forced to sell at unfavorable time
- Could face penalties for non-compliance

**Solution:**
- Consider your long-term visa plans before buying
- Focus on new dwellings if uncertain about permanent residency
- Plan for potential need to sell
- Consider timing purchase closer to permanent visa grant

### Mistake 5: Confusing Developer Exemption Certificates

**The problem:**
Thinking exemption certificate means no FIRB requirements at all.

**Reality:**
- Exemption certificate held by developer
- You still need to notify ATO within 30 days
- Still subject to FIRB conditions
- Still must be eligible type of buyer

**Solution:**
Even with developer exemption certificate, confirm your obligations and notify ATO promptly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I'm on a student visa. Can I buy a property to live in while studying?**

A: Yes, but only new dwellings, house-and-land packages, or vacant land. You cannot buy established houses or apartments due to the current ban (April 2025 - March 2027). You'll need FIRB approval and must pay the application fee.

**Q: What happens if I get permanent residency after buying as a temporary resident?**

A: Once you become a permanent resident, you're no longer subject to FIRB requirements or conditions. You can keep the property indefinitely, convert it to an investment, and purchase additional properties (including established dwellings) without FIRB approval.

**Q: My temporary visa expires in 11 months. Can I still buy property?**

A: Your visa must allow continuous stay of 12+ months to qualify as a temporary resident. If it's under 12 months, you're treated as a non-resident foreign person with more restricted rights. Consider renewing your visa first.

**Q: Can I buy property with my Australian boyfriend/girlfriend?**

A: The spousal exemption only applies to legally recognized relationships (married or registered de facto). Dating relationships don't qualify. If you're in a de facto relationship, you may need to prove it meets legal requirements (typically 12+ months cohabitation).

**Q: I'm on a 485 Graduate visa. Does this qualify as a temporary resident visa?**

A: Yes, the 485 Graduate visa allows continuous stay for 18 months to 4 years, so you qualify as a temporary resident. You can buy new dwellings and vacant land with FIRB approval but cannot buy established dwellings during the ban period.

**Q: Do I need FIRB approval if buying an investment property off-the-plan?**

A: Yes, temporary residents need FIRB approval for each new dwelling purchase, even if buying off-the-plan. However, if the developer has an exemption certificate, you may not need individual approval—just notification to ATO within 30 days of purchase.

**Q: What if I'm buying with my spouse who is also a temporary resident?**

A: You'll both need FIRB approval. The spousal exemption only works if one partner is an Australian citizen or permanent resident. If both partners are temporary residents or foreign nationals, standard FIRB rules apply.

**Q: Can I apply for FIRB approval before finding a specific property?**

A: Generally no. FIRB approval is property-specific. However, you can apply for an Exemption Certificate that allows you to purchase one unspecified new dwelling within 12 months. This costs the same as a standard application but provides flexibility.

**Q: I bought as a temporary resident in 2023. Do I have to sell now because of the 2025 ban?**

A: No. The ban on established dwellings only applies to NEW purchases from April 1, 2025. If you already own property purchased with proper FIRB approval before the ban, you can keep it (subject to your original FIRB conditions).
