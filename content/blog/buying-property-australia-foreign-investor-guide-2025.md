# Buying Property in Australia: The 2025 Guide for Foreign Investors

**Last Updated: December 2025**

Is the Australian property market open to foreign buyers in 2025? The short answer is yes—but the rules have changed drastically.

Effective April 1, 2025, the Australian Government introduced strict new measures to prioritise housing for locals. For foreign investors, the strategy has shifted from "buying what you want" to "buying what you build."

This guide cuts through the marketing noise to give you the verified legislative reality. We break down the ban on established homes, the state-by-state surcharges, and the specific pathway that remains open for smart investors.

## The Golden Rule: What Can Foreigners Buy in 2025?

The most critical update for 2025 is the **Established Dwelling Ban**.

### The Hard Stop

From **April 1, 2025** to **March 31, 2027**, foreign investors are generally banned from purchasing established dwellings—homes that have been lived in before. This includes:

❌ Existing houses on the secondary market  
❌ Second-hand apartments  
❌ Any previously occupied residential property

### The "Fixer-Upper" Myth

You generally cannot buy an older home to renovate. The "fixer-upper" strategy is effectively off-limits for individual foreign investors unless you plan to demolish and build **at least 20 new dwellings** on the site—a threshold most individual buyers cannot meet.

### The Open Pathway: Buy New

The Australian government actively encourages foreign investment into **new dwellings**. Buying a brand-new property (one that has never been occupied or sold) is your path of least resistance.

What qualifies as a new dwelling:

✅ Off-the-plan apartments  
✅ House-and-land packages  
✅ Newly constructed homes never previously occupied  
✅ Vacant land (with requirement to build within 4 years)

This approach aligns with national housing goals to increase supply, meaning fewer regulatory hurdles and lower FIRB fees.

## The Cost of Entry: Surcharges and Fees

A common mistake foreign buyers make is assuming the list price is the purchase price. In 2025, you must budget for the "double cost" reality—state taxes and federal fees that can add **15–20% to your upfront costs**.

### FIRB Application Fees

Before you can buy, you must apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).

**Current fees (2025–26 financial year):**

| Property Value | New Dwelling Fee | Established Dwelling Fee |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Up to $1M      | $15,100          | $45,300 (tripled)        |
| $1M – $2M      | $30,300          | $90,900                  |
| $2M – $3M      | $60,600          | $181,800                 |
| $3M – $4M      | $90,900          | $272,700                 |
| $4M – $5M      | $121,200         | $363,600                 |

**Important:** FIRB fees are generally non-refundable if your application is rejected or you fail to secure the property. However, a 75% refund may be available for unsuccessful competitive bids.

For complete fee breakdowns, see our [FIRB Fees Guide](/en/blog/firb-fees-tripled-2024-guide).

### State Stamp Duty Surcharges

Most Australian states charge a foreign buyer surcharge on top of standard stamp duty. These are the current 2025 rates:

| State/Territory        | Foreign Surcharge | Notes                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **New South Wales**    | 9%                | Increased from 8% (Jan 1, 2025)  |
| **Victoria**           | 8%                | Highest base stamp duty rates    |
| **Queensland**         | 8%                | Increased from 7% (July 1, 2024) |
| **Tasmania**           | 8%                | Strict documentation required    |
| **South Australia**    | 7%                | —                                |
| **Western Australia**  | 7%                | —                                |
| **ACT**                | 0%                | No foreign buyer surcharge       |
| **Northern Territory** | 0%                | No foreign buyer surcharge       |

### Real Cost Example

For a **$800,000 new apartment in NSW**:

| Cost Item                    | Amount        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Purchase price               | $800,000      |
| Standard stamp duty          | ~$31,000      |
| Foreign buyer surcharge (9%) | $72,000       |
| FIRB application fee         | $15,100       |
| Legal/conveyancing           | ~$2,500       |
| **Total upfront costs**      | **~$920,600** |

That's approximately **15% above the purchase price** in government fees alone.

## Financing: The Cash Buffer Reality

If you require a mortgage, be aware that Australian banks have tightened lending criteria for non-residents.

### What to Expect

- **LVR limits:** Most major banks cap lending at 60–70% of property value for non-residents
- **Higher interest rates:** Typically 0.5–1% above standard resident rates
- **Stricter documentation:** Extensive proof of overseas income required

### The Liquidity Requirement

Between your 30–40% deposit and the ~15% in taxes and fees, you effectively need **approximately 50% of the purchase price in liquid cash** to close a deal.

**Example:** For an $800,000 property, budget for $400,000+ in available funds.

## Strategic FAQ: Quick Answers for Investors

### Can temporary residents buy established homes in 2025?

Generally, no. The April 1, 2025 ban includes temporary residents purchasing established dwellings for use as a principal place of residence, subject to very limited exceptions. Focus on new builds or vacant land.

For visa-specific guidance, see our [Temporary Resident vs. Foreign Investor Guide](/en/blog/temporary-resident-vs-foreign-investor-firb-visa-guide).

### What is the Vacancy Fee?

If you leave your property empty for more than 183 days (approximately 6 months) in a year, you'll be charged an annual vacancy fee equal to **double your original FIRB application fee**.

For a $800,000 new dwelling, that's $30,200 per year if left vacant.

You must lodge a Vacancy Fee Return every year, even if the property is tenanted.

### Is it easier to buy in a development?

Yes. Look for developers holding a **New Dwelling Exemption Certificate**. This allows them to sell new apartments to foreign buyers without you needing individual FIRB approval, saving you roughly 30 days and streamlining the purchase process.

### Which states have the lowest costs for foreign buyers?

The **Northern Territory** and **ACT** charge no foreign buyer stamp duty surcharge, making them significantly cheaper for foreign investors. However, consider market size and growth potential alongside tax savings.

See our [State-by-State Foreign Buyer Stamp Duty Guide](/en/blog/foreign-buyer-stamp-duty-surcharges-by-state-2025) for detailed comparisons.

## Your 2025 Action Plan

### Step 1: Filter Your Search

Only look at "New Homes" or "Off-the-Plan" projects. Established dwellings are off-limits until at least March 31, 2027.

### Step 2: Calculate Your True Costs

Run your specific scenario through the [PropertyCosts Calculator](https://www.propertycosts.com.au/en) to verify your total tax liability including FIRB fees, stamp duty, and surcharges.

### Step 3: Secure Your Cash Position

Ensure you have access to approximately 50% of the property value in transferable funds. If transferring from overseas, account for currency control limits in your home country and allow adequate time for transfers.

### Step 4: Verify the Developer

Ask specifically if the project has a **New Dwelling Exemption Certificate**. This simplifies your purchase process significantly and confirms the property qualifies as a new dwelling.

### Step 5: Apply for FIRB Early

Submit your FIRB application before signing contracts, or ensure your contract includes a "subject to FIRB approval" condition. Allow at least 30 days for processing.
