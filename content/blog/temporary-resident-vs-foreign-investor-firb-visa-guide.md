# Temporary Resident vs. Foreign Investor: Which FIRB Rules Apply to Your Visa?

**Last Updated: November 2025**

Are you on a 482 work visa, student visa, or partner visa wondering if you can buy property in Australia? The answer depends entirely on whether you're classified as a "temporary resident" or "foreign non-resident"—and the distinction matters enormously.

**Temporary residents** can buy one established dwelling to live in (though this is banned from April 2025 to March 2027). **Foreign non-residents** cannot buy established dwellings at all, except in very limited circumstances.

This comprehensive guide explains exactly which rules apply to your specific visa, what you can and cannot buy, and how to navigate FIRB requirements without costly mistakes.

## Quick Answer: What Can I Buy on My Visa?

| Visa Type                       | Classification       | Can Buy Established?      | Can Buy New?           | Can Buy Vacant Land?   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |

## The Critical Distinction: Temporary Resident vs. Foreign Non-Resident

### Who Is a Temporary Resident?

According to [FIRB Guidance Note 6](https://foreigninvestment.gov.au/guidance-resources/guidance-notes/gn06), you're a **temporary resident** if:

**Option 1:** You hold a temporary visa that permits you to remain in Australia for a **continuous period of more than 12 months**, regardless of how much time remains on your visa

**OR**

**Option 2:** You:

- Currently reside in Australia, AND
- Have submitted an application for a permanent visa, AND
- Hold a bridging visa that allows you to stay in Australia until your permanent visa application is finalized

### Who Is a Foreign Non-Resident?

You're a **foreign non-resident** if:

- You hold NO Australian visa
- You hold a temporary visa valid for **less than 12 months**
- You're overseas and not currently in Australia
- You're on a tourist or visitor visa

### Why Does This Matter?

The classification determines:

1. **What property types** you can purchase
2. **How many properties** you can buy
3. **What conditions** apply to your purchase
4. **Whether you must sell** when leaving Australia
5. **FIRB application fees** (same for both, but different rules)

## Visa-by-Visa Breakdown: Your Specific Rights

### 482 Visa (Temporary Skill Shortage / Skills in Demand)

**Classification:** Temporary Resident
**Visa Duration:** Initially up to 4 years
**FIRB Status:** Require approval

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings** (new homes, off-the-plan apartments)

- No restrictions on quantity
- Can be for investment or personal use
- Each purchase requires separate FIRB approval

✅ **Vacant residential land**

- Must build within 4 years of FIRB approval
- Submit completion evidence within 30 days

#### What You CANNOT Buy (April 2025 - March 2027):

❌ **Established dwellings** for personal residence

- Temporary ban in effect from April 1, 2025
- Previously could buy ONE established dwelling to live in
- Ban subject to review and may be extended

#### Conditions & Requirements:

- **FIRB approval:** Required for ALL purchases
- **Application fee:** $42,300+ for established (if ban lifts), $14,100+ for new dwellings
- **Stamp duty surcharge:** 7-9% depending on state (see [State-by-State Foreign Buyer Stamp Duty Surcharges](/en/blog/foreign-buyer-stamp-duty-surcharges-by-state-2025))
- **Exit requirement:** N/A for new dwellings purchased for investment
- **Spousal exemption:** If buying with Australian citizen/PR spouse as joint tenants, may avoid FIRB and surcharges

#### Real Example:

_Sarah is on a 482 visa as a software engineer in Melbourne. She can buy an off-the-plan apartment for $600,000 as an investment property. She'll need:_

- _FIRB approval: $14,100_
- _VIC stamp duty: $32,000_
- _VIC foreign buyer surcharge: $48,000_
- _Total upfront costs: $94,100_

_If she buys with her Australian PR husband as joint tenants, she avoids FIRB and the $48,000 surcharge._

### 485 Visa (Temporary Graduate)

**Classification:** Temporary Resident
**Visa Duration:** 18 months to 4 years (depends on qualification)
**FIRB Status:** Require approval

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings**
✅ **Vacant residential land** (must build within 4 years)

#### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025 - March 2027)

#### Special Considerations:

**Shorter visa duration** means:

- Banks may require **larger deposits** (20-30% vs. 10-20% for longer visas)
- Some lenders won't approve loans if less than 12 months remain
- **Strategy:** If planning to buy, do so early in your visa period OR wait until you transition to TSS/PR

#### Transition Tip:

Many 485 holders transition to 482 or apply for PR (189/190/491). If you're close to getting a longer visa or PR, **waiting may save you $50,000+ in surcharges and FIRB fees.**

---

### 500 Student Visa

**Classification:** Temporary Resident (if visa duration exceeds 12 months)
**Visa Duration:** Course length + additional time
**FIRB Status:** Require approval

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings**

- Popular for international students whose parents want to invest
- Can purchase for investment purposes

✅ **Vacant residential land**

- Must complete construction within 4 years
- Good option for long-term students (3-4 year degrees)

#### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025 - March 2027)

#### Financing Challenges for Student Visa Holders:

Student visas face the **strictest lending criteria**:

- Most banks require **Australian employment income**
- Some lenders require 30-40% deposits
- **Parental guarantee** loans may be available

**Workaround:** Parents can purchase in their own name (as foreign non-residents) or jointly with student as tenants in common.

#### Real Example:

_Jason is an international student from China on a 500 visa (3-year Bachelor's degree). His parents want to buy a $500,000 apartment in Sydney for him to live in while studying, then rent out afterward._

_Options:_

1. _Parents buy as foreign non-residents: FIRB $14,100, stamp duty $74,000_
2. _Joint purchase (Jason 1%, parents 99%): Still face same costs as Jason is temporary resident_
3. _Wait until Jason gets 485 visa, then buy: Same costs but Jason has better loan prospects_

---

### 820/801 Partner Visa

**Classification:** Temporary Resident (820 subclass)
**Visa Duration:** 820 is temporary, 801 is permanent
**FIRB Status:** Depends on which stage

#### Subclass 820 (Temporary Partner Visa):

**Classification:** Temporary Resident

**What You CAN Buy:**

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings**
✅ **Vacant residential land**

**What You CANNOT Buy:**

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025-March 2027)

#### Subclass 801 (Permanent Partner Visa):

**Classification:** NOT a foreign person (exempt from FIRB)

**What You CAN Buy:**

✅ **Everything** - no FIRB approval needed
✅ **No stamp duty surcharges**
✅ **No restrictions**

#### The Strategic Advantage: Buying with Your Australian Partner

If your partner is an Australian citizen or PR:

- **Buy as joint tenants** (not tenants in common)
- **Avoid FIRB approval** entirely
- **Avoid stamp duty surcharges** (saving 7-9%)

**Example savings on $700,000 property in NSW:**

- Without spousal exemption: $97,000 in surcharges + $42,300 FIRB = $139,300
- With spousal exemption (joint tenants): $0

This is **THE most valuable exemption** for temporary residents.

#### Real Example:

_Maria is on an 820 partner visa married to an Australian citizen. They want to buy a $800,000 house in Brisbane._

_Option A: Maria buys alone_

- _Cannot buy established (banned)_
- _Can buy new: FIRB $42,300, QLD stamp duty + 8% surcharge = $97,000_

_Option B: Buy with husband as joint tenants_

- _No FIRB required_
- _No surcharge (saves $64,000)_
- _Standard stamp duty only: $31,000_
- _**Total savings: $75,300**_

---

### 491/494 Regional Provisional Visas

**Classification:** Temporary Resident
**Visa Duration:** 5 years (pathway to PR via 191)
**FIRB Status:** Require approval

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings** (in any location, not just regional)
✅ **Vacant residential land**

#### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025-March 2027)

#### Regional Considerations:

**Advantages:**

- 5-year visa gives better **loan approval** prospects
- Regional areas often have **lower property prices**
- Can buy investment property in Sydney/Melbourne even if living regionally

**Common Question:** "Do I have to buy in a regional area?"
**Answer:** No. Your visa requires you to live/work regionally, but FIRB doesn't restrict where you can buy property.

#### Strategy for 491/494 Holders:

Since you're on a 5-year pathway to PR (191 visa):

1. **Build equity** by buying regional new dwelling at lower price point
2. **Wait for PR** (after 3 years on 491/494)
3. **Buy established property** in major city after obtaining PR (no restrictions, no surcharges)

---

### 188 Business Innovation and Investment Visas

**Classification:** Temporary Resident
**Visa Duration:** Varies by stream (typically 4-5 years)
**Pathway:** To 888 permanent visa

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings**
✅ **Vacant residential land**
✅ **Commercial property** (separate rules, generally easier)

#### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025-March 2027)

#### Special Consideration for 888 Pathway:

Owning property in Australia can help meet 888 visa requirements:

- **Personal and business assets in Australia** worth AUD $600,000+ (one of three criteria)
- Property ownership demonstrates **commitment to Australia**
- Can contribute to meeting asset thresholds

**Strategy:** Purchasing property early in your 188 visa can position you better for 888 application.

---

### Bridging Visas (Awaiting PR Decision)

**Classification:** Temporary Resident
**FIRB Status:** Require approval (same as temporary residents)

#### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **Unlimited new dwellings**
✅ **Vacant residential land**

#### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** (banned April 2025-March 2027)

#### Critical Timing Question:

_"Should I buy now on my bridging visa or wait for PR?"_

**Wait if:**

- PR decision expected within 3-6 months
- You want to buy established property (banned for temporary residents)
- Saving 7-9% surcharge is worth the wait
- You're not in a rush

**Buy now if:**

- PR decision timeline uncertain (12+ months)
- Buying new/off-the-plan (surcharge still applies but can't avoid it by waiting)
- Market conditions favorable
- Have found ideal property

#### Refund Opportunity:

Some states (notably NSW) offer **stamp duty surcharge refunds** if you obtain PR within 12 months of purchase. Check state-specific rules.

## Foreign Non-Residents: What Can You Buy?

If you're NOT a temporary resident (no visa, tourist visa, or short-term visa under 12 months), you're a **foreign non-resident**.

### What You CAN Buy:

✅ **New dwellings** (with FIRB approval)
✅ **Vacant residential land** (with FIRB approval, must build within 4 years)
✅ **Property for redevelopment** (if increasing housing stock)

### What You CANNOT Buy:

❌ **Established dwellings** for any purpose (except very limited exceptions)
❌ **Established dwellings for investment**
❌ **Holiday homes** (established)

### Exceptions for Foreign Non-Residents:

**Corporate Housing:** Foreign companies can buy established dwellings to house Australian-based staff (strict conditions apply)

**Redevelopment:** Can buy established property if:

- Genuinely increasing Australia's housing stock
- Demolishing existing dwelling
- Building multiple new dwellings
- Meeting development timelines

---

## The April 2025 Established Dwelling Ban: What Changed?

### What Happened:

On **April 1, 2025**, the Australian Government implemented a **temporary 2-year ban** on foreign purchases of established dwellings, running until **March 31, 2027**.

### Who It Affects:

- ❌ **Temporary residents** (previously could buy ONE established dwelling to live in)
- ❌ **Foreign non-residents** (already couldn't buy established, now explicitly banned)

### Limited Exceptions:

The ban does NOT apply to:

1. **Build-to-Rent projects** (20+ dwellings, specific criteria)
2. **Major redevelopment** (creating 20+ new dwellings)
3. **Commercial-scale housing** projects

### What This Means for You:

**Before April 1, 2025:**

- 482 visa holder could buy one $700,000 established house to live in
- Pay FIRB $42,300 + stamp duty surcharges

**After April 1, 2025:**

- Same 482 visa holder **cannot** buy that established house
- Must buy new/off-the-plan or vacant land
- OR wait until obtaining PR

### Strategy Implications:

**If you're on a temporary visa and wanted to buy established:**

1. **Accelerate PR application** if eligible
2. **Consider new construction** instead
3. **Buy with Australian spouse** as joint tenants (may qualify for exemption - check current rules)
4. **Wait until March 2027** (or later if ban extended)

## Buying with an Australian Citizen or PR: The Ultimate Exemption

This is the **single most valuable strategy** for temporary residents.

### The Joint Tenants Exemption:

If you purchase residential property with someone who is:

- An Australian citizen, OR
- An Australian permanent resident, OR
- A New Zealand citizen with special category visa (subclass 444)

...AND you structure the purchase as **joint tenants** (NOT tenants in common), you may be eligible for:

✅ **FIRB exemption** (no application needed)
✅ **Stamp duty surcharge exemption** (save 7-9%)
✅ **Can buy established dwellings** (even during 2025-2027 ban in some states - verify current rules)

### Joint Tenants vs. Tenants in Common:

**Joint Tenants:**

- Equal ownership (50/50)
- Right of survivorship (property goes to survivor if one dies)
- **Qualifies for exemption**

**Tenants in Common:**

- Can own unequal shares (e.g., 70/30)
- Can will your share to someone else
- **Does NOT qualify for exemption** - surcharge applies to foreign person's share

### Requirements:

Must be in a **spousal relationship** (married or de facto) - doesn't apply to:

- Business partners
- Friends
- Siblings
- Parents/children

### Real Calculation:

**$900,000 property in Victoria**

|                              | Temporary Resident Alone | With Australian Spouse (Joint Tenants) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Standard stamp duty          | $49,000                  | $49,000                                |
| Foreign buyer surcharge (8%) | $72,000                  | **$0** ✅                              |
| FIRB application fee         | $42,300                  | **$0** ✅                              |
| **TOTAL**                    | **$163,300**             | **$49,000**                            |
| **SAVINGS**                  | -                        | **$114,300**                           |

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Buying Without FIRB Approval

**Consequence:** Fines up to $3.3M, forced sale, criminal prosecution
**Solution:** ALWAYS get approval before purchasing or make contract conditional

### Mistake #2: Assuming You Don't Need FIRB Because You Live in Australia

**Reality:** Your visa status matters, not your physical location
**Solution:** Check your visa classification, not residency status

### Mistake #3: Buying as Tenants in Common Instead of Joint Tenants

**Consequence:** Lose spousal exemption, pay full surcharges
**Solution:** If buying with Australian spouse, structure as joint tenants

### Mistake #4: Not Disclosing Visa Status to Conveyancer

**Consequence:** Penalties, delays, contract issues
**Solution:** Tell your conveyancer/lawyer about your visa status immediately

### Mistake #5: Buying Established Property on Temporary Visa (Post-April 2025)

**Consequence:** Contract void, FIRB rejection, lost deposit
**Solution:** Only buy new dwellings or vacant land until ban lifts

### Mistake #6: Forgetting to Sell When Leaving Australia

**Consequence:** Penalties, forced sale, potential legal action
**Solution:** Set reminders for 3 months before visa expiry

### Mistake #7: Not Budgeting for Surcharges

**Consequence:** Financial strain, deal falls through
**Solution:** Use calculator to get complete cost breakdown upfront

### Mistake #8: Buying Too Close to Visa Expiry

**Consequence:** Lenders reject application, must sell quickly
**Solution:** Buy early in visa period or ensure transitioning to PR/longer visa

## FAQs: Your Questions Answered

A:

- **New dwelling:** Never been lived in OR not occupied for more than 12 months total

A: Yes! Temporary residents can buy new dwellings for investment purposes and rent them out.

**Q: I'm on a student visa. Can my parents buy a property for me?**

## Decision Framework: Should You Buy Now or Wait?

### Buy Now (on Temporary Visa) If:

✅ You're buying **new dwelling/vacant land** (no advantage to waiting)
✅ You have **5+ years on current visa**
✅ PR timeline is **uncertain** (18+ months away)
✅ You're buying with **Australian spouse as joint tenants**
✅ Market conditions are **favorable**
✅ You have **secure employment** and can get loan approval
✅ You're comfortable with the **surcharges and restrictions**

### Wait for PR If:

⏸️ PR decision expected **within 6-12 months**
⏸️ You want to buy **established property** (currently banned for temporary residents)
⏸️ You'd save **significant money** on surcharges (7-9% of property value)
⏸️ You're not buying with **exempt spouse**
⏸️ Property market is **cooling** (no urgency)
⏸️ You're on a **short visa** (12-24 months remaining)
⏸️ Your deposit is **borderline** for temporary resident loan approval

### Calculate Your Personal Breakpoint:

**Example:** $700,000 property in NSW

- **Surcharge if buying now:** $63,000
- **FIRB fee:** $14,100 (new) or $42,300 (established)
- **Total extra cost as temporary resident:** $77,100 to $105,300

**If you wait 12 months for PR:**

- Surcharge saved: $63,000 to $105,300
- But: Property may appreciate 3-5% = $21,000 to $35,000
- **Net savings by waiting:** $42,000 to $70,000
